ACT ONE

Overture

A rocky place, partly tree-clad. Hills on both sides. A temple.
Tamino comes down from a rock, with a bow but no arrows. He is pursued by a serpent.

No. 1 - Introduction

TAMINO
Help! Help, or I am lost,
doomed to fall prey to the cunning serpent!
Merciful gods!
Now it's coming nearer!
Ah, save me!
Ah, defend me!

He faints.
Three veiled ladies come out of the temple, each with a silver javelin.

THE THREE LADIES
Perish, monster, at our hands!
They kill the serpent.
Victory! Victory! It is accomplished,
the heroic deed! He is delivered
by the boldness of our arms!

FIRST LADY
looking at Tamino
A charming young man, tender and beautiful!

SECOND LADY
So beautiful a youth I have never seen before.

THIRD LADY
Yes, yes! Truly, as pretty as a picture.

THE THREE LADIES
If I were to dedicate my heart to love,
it would have to be this young man.
Let us hasten to our sovereign,
and give her these tidings:
it may be that this fair man
can restore her lost repose.

FIRST LADY
Go then and tell her.
I'll stay here meanwhile.

SECOND LADY
No, no, you two go.
I'll watch over him here!

THIRD LADY
No, no! That cannot be.
I will guard him alone.

FIRST LADY
I'll stay here meanwhile!

SECOND LADY
I'll watch over him here!

THIRD LADY
I will guard him alone!

FIRST LADY
I'll stay!

SECOND LADY
I'll watch!

THIRD LADY
I'll guard!

THE THREE LADIES
I, I, I!
(I'm supposed to go? Well, well, that would be a fine thing!
They want to be alone with him.
No, no, that cannot be!
What would I not give
to live with this young man!
If only I had him quite alone!
Yet no one's going; it cannot be.
It is best if I go now!)
Fair and lovable young man,
dear young man, farewell!
Until I see you again!

All three leave by the temple door.

TAMINO
waking up
Where am I? Is it my imagination that I am still alive? Or have I been saved by a higher power? - What? - The serpent dead?
What's that I hear? Where am I? - I don't recognize this place?! - There, a strange figure is coming this way.

Tamino hides behind a tree. During the introduction Papageno comes down a path, carrying on his back a large birdcage containing various birds. He holds a panpipe in both hands.


No. 2 - Aria

PAPAGENO
The bird-catcher, that's me,
always cheerful, hip hooray!
As a bird-catcher I'm known
to young and old throughout the land.
I know how to set about luring
and how to be good at piping.
That's why I can be merry and cheerful,
for all the birds are surely mine.

The bird-catcher, that's me,
always cheerful, hip hooray!
As a bird-catcher I'm known
to young and old throughout the land.
I'd like a net for girls,
I'd catch them for myself by the dozen!
Then I'd lock them up with me,
and all the girls would be mine.

If all the girls were mine,
I'd barter plenty of sugar:
the one I liked best,
I'd give her the sugar at once.
And if then she kissed me tenderly,
she would be my wife and I her husband.
She'd fall asleep at my side,
and I'd rock her like a child.

He is about to go to the door.

TAMINO
Hey there!

PAPAGENO
What's that?

TAMINO
Tell me, my cheerful friend, who you are.

PAPAGENO
Who I am? Silly question! A man like you. - And who are you?

TAMINO
I am a Prince.

PAPAGENO
That's all above my head. You'll have to explain yourself more clearly if I'm to understand!

TAMINO
My father is a sovereign who rules over many lands and peoples. That's why I am called "Prince".

PAPAGENO
Lands? Peoples? - I might try the market for my birds there.

TAMINO
Now you tell me what the place is actually called. Who rules here?

PAPAGENO
I cannot answer you that, any more than I know how I came into the world. All I know is that not far from here stands my straw hut, which protects me from rain and cold.

TAMINO
But how do you live?

PAPAGENO
By eating and drinking, like everyone does.

TAMINO
How do you obtain that?

PAPAGENO
By barter. I catch various birds for the star-blazing Queen and her ladies; every day in return I receive food and drink from her.

TAMINO
(The star-blazing Queen?)
Tell me, good friend, have you ever been so fortunate as to see her?

PAPAGENO
See her? See the star-blazing Queen? What mortal can claim to have ever seen her? But - why are you looking at me so suspiciously?

TAMINO
Because - because I doubt if you are human. By the feathers you are covered in I think you are a ...

PAPAGENO
Surely not a bird? - Stand back, for I have the strength of giants!

TAMINO
Then you must be my rescuer, who killed the evil serpent?

PAPAGENO
Serpent?

TAMINO
... and how did you fight this monster? You have no weapons!

PAPAGENO
Don't need any! With me a good squeeze of the hand is better than weapons.

TAMINO
So you throttled it?

PAPAGENO
Throttled!

Enter the three ladies.

THE THREE LADIES
Papageno!

PAPAGENO
That means me!

TAMINO
Who are these ladies?

PAPAGENO
Who they really are I don't know myself. As I already told you, all I know is that they collect my birds from me daily and in return bring me wine, cake and sweet figs.

THE THREE LADIES
Papageno!

PAPAGENO
(What have I done today to make them so angry at me?) Here, my beauties, I'll hand over my birds to you.

FIRST LADY
passes him a beautiful flask of water
In return our sovereign is today sending you pure, clear water instead of wine.

SECOND LADY
And she has commanded me to bring you this stone instead of cake.

PAPAGENO
What? You want me to feed on stones?

THIRD LADY
And instead of sweet figs I am hanging this golden lock in front of your mouth.

PAPAGENO
Hm!

FIRST LADY
I expect you would like to know why our sovereign lady is punishing you so strangely today?

PAPAGENO
Hm!

SECOND LADY
So that in future you will not tell lies to strangers any more!

THIRD LADY
And never again boast of heroic deeds performed by others.

FIRST LADY
Speak! Did you fight this serpent?

PAPAGENO
Hm!

TAMINO
Who did then?

THIRD LADY
It was we, young man, who saved you. Here, our great sovereign sends you this; it is a portrait of her daughter Pamina. "If you find you are not indifferent to these features", she says, "then happiness, honour and fame are your lot!" - Goodbye!

Exeunt the three ladies.


No. 3 - Aria

TAMINO
This portrait is enchantingly beautiful,
such as no eye has ever yet seen.
I feel the way this divine image
fills my heart with new emotion.
Though I cannot name what this is,
yet I feel it burning here like fire.
Might this sensation be love?
Yes, yes! It can only be love!
Oh, if only I could find her!
Oh, if she but stood before me now!
I should ... should ... warmly and virtuously ...
What should I do? ...
Rapturously I should
press her to this ardent breast,
and then she would be mine for ever.

Tamino is about to go. Enter the three ladies.

FIRST LADY
Steel yourself with courage and constancy, Tamino!

SECOND LADY
The Queen of the Night, our sovereign, has heard every word you have said. If this young man", she said, "is as bold and valiant as he is tender, then my daughter Pamina is saved!"

TAMINO
Saved?

THIRD LADY
A powerful, evil demon named Sarastro has stolen her away.

TAMINO
Stolen? Where is Sarastro's domain?

FIRST LADY
Very close to our mountains. His castle is imposing and carefully guarded.

thunder

TAMINO
What is that?

SECOND LADY
Our Queen comes!

Scene change. The mountains part. A resplendent room.
The Queen of the Night sits on a throne decorated with stars.


No. 4 - Recitative and Aria

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
Oh, do not tremble, my dear son!
You are guiltless, wise, and pious.
A young man like you is best able
to comfort the deeply distressed heart of a mother.

Suffering is my lot,
for my daughter is not with me.
Through her I have lost all my happiness;
a villain made off with her.
I still see her trembling
with alarm and shock,
quivering with anxiety,
struggling timidly.
I had to see her stolen from me,
"Ah help!" was all she said;
but her pleading was in vain,
for my aid was too feeble.
You will go to free her,
you will be the rescuer of my daughter.
And if I see you as victor,
then may she be yours for ever.

Exit, with the three ladies.
Scene change. The mountains draw together again.

TAMINO
Can what I have seen be real?

PAPAGENO
Hm!

TAMINO
Oh, Papageno - how shall we remove the lock from your mouth?


No. 5 - Quintet

PAPAGENO
steps in front of Tamino and points ruefully at the lock on his mouth
Hm, hm, hm, hiri. hm, hm, hm, hm!

TAMINO
The poor man can talk about punishment,
for he has lost his speech.

PAPAGENO
Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm!

TAMINO
I can only pity you,
because I have no power to help.

PAPAGENO
Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm!

Enter the three ladies.

FIRST LADY
to Papageno
The Queen pardons you,
remits your punishment through me.

She takes the lock off his mouth.

PAPAGENO
Now Papageno can chatter again.

SECOND LADY
Yes, chatter! Only do not tell any more lies!

PAPAGENO
I'll never tell another lie. No, no!

THE THREE LADIES
Let this lock be a warning to you!

PAPAGENO
This lock shall be a warning to me!

ALL
For if all liars received
a lock like this on their mouths,
instead of hatred, calumny, and black gall,
love and brotherhood would flourish.

FIRST LADY
giving Tamino a golden flute
O Prince, take this gift from me!
Our sovereign sends it to you.
The magic flute will protect you,
and sustain you in the greatest misfortune.

THE THREE LADIES
By it you may act with all power,
change the passions of men:
the sorrower will be joyful,
the old bachelor fall in love.

ALL
Oh, such a flute is worth more
than gold and crowns,
for through it human happiness
and contentment will be increased.

PAPAGENO
Now, fair wenches,
if I may - I'll take my leave.

THE THREE LADIES
You can certainly take your leave,
but our sovereign intends you
to accompany the Prince without delay
and hasten to Sarastro's fortress.

PAPAGENO
No, thank you very much!
I have heard from you yourselves
that he is like a tiger.
Certainly, with no mercy,
Sarastro would have me plucked and roasted
and fed to the dogs.

THE THREE LADIES
The Prince will protect you, only trust in him!
In return you shall be his servant.

PAPAGENO
(The Prince can go to the devil!
My life is dear to me.
In the end, I'll swear,
he'll steal away from me like a thief.)

FIRST LADY
giving Papageno a glockenspiel
Here, take this treasure, it is for you.

PAPAGENO
Well, now! What might be in there?

THE THREE LADIES
In there you'll hear little bells ringing.

PAPAGENO
And can I play them as well?

THE THREE LADIES
Oh, quite certainly! Yes, yes, certainly!

ALL
Silver chimes, magic flutes
are needed for your/our protection.
Farewell, we are going.
Farewell, until we see you again!
All are about to go.

TAMINO
Yet, fair ladies, tell us ...

PAPAGENO
How the castle may be found.

TAMINO, PAPAGENO
How the castle may be found.

THE THREE LADIES
Three boys, young, beautiful, gracious, and wise,
will accompany you on your journey.
They will be your guides,
follow nothing but their advice.

TAMINO, PAPAGENO
Three boys, young, beautiful, gracious, and wise,
will accompany us on our journey.

THE THREE LADIES
They will be your guides,
follow nothing but their advice.

ALL
So farewell, we are going;
farewell, farewell, until we see you again!

Exeunt

Scene change. Magnificent room in Sarastro's palace
Enter Monostatos. Pamina is brought in by slaves.

SLAVE
We've caught Pamina again trying to escape


No. 6 - Trio

MONOSTATOS
You sweet little dove, just come on in.

PAMINA
Oh, what torture! What agony!

MONOSTATOS
Your life is forfeit!

PAMINA
Death does not frighten me;
I am sorry only for my mother,
she will quite certainly die of grief.

MONOSTATOS
Here, slaves! Chain her up!
They chain her up.
My hatred shall destroy you.

PAMINA
Oh, rather let me die,
barbarian, since nothing will move you!
She faints onto a sofa.

MONOSTATOS
Now go! Leave me alone with her!
Exeunt slaves.

PAPAGENO
outside the window
Where am I then? Where can this be?
Aha, I've found some people here.
Courage; I'll go in.
He goes in.
Lovely girl, young and sweet,
much paler even than chalk!

MONOSTATOS, PAPAGENO
starting at each other
Aah! That must be the devil!
Have pity! Spare me!
Aah! aah! Aah!
Monostatos runs off.

PAPAGENO
Am I not a fool to have been so frightened? There are certainly black birds in the world, so why not black men as well? - Ah look! This must be Pamina! You Queen of the Night's daughter!

PAMINA
Who are you?

PAPAGENO
A messenger from the star-blazing Queen.

PAMINA
My mother? Your name?

PAPAGENO
Papageno.

PAMINA
Papageno? - Why did you come?

PAPAGENO
Early today I came to your mother's palace to hand over my birds as usual. There suddenly I saw before me a man who calls himself a Prince. - This Prince so impressed your mother that she presented him with your portrait and commanded him to rescue you. From that moment he has loved you.

PAMINA
He loves me? - But then tell me, why doesn't he come?

PAPAGENO
To be safe, the Prince sent me on ahead to announce his arrival.

PAMINA
You have taken a great risk. If Sarastro were to see you here...

PAPAGENO
...that would save me the trip back!

PAMINA
And your sweetheart would wait for you in vain.

PAPAGENO
No-one is waiting for me.

PAMINA
Poor man! So you haven't a wife then?

PAPAGENO
Not so much as a girl friend, let alone a wife!

PAMINA
Have patience, my friend. Heaven will provide for you too and send you a girl friend before you know it!


No. 7 - Duet

PAMINA
In men who feel love,
a good heart, too, is never lacking.

PAPAGENO
Sharing these sweet urges
is then women's first duty.

PAMINA, PAPAGENO
We want to enjoy love;
it is through love alone that we live.

PAMINA
Love sweetens every sorrow;
every creature pays homage to it.

PAPAGENO
It gives relish to the days of our life,
it acts in the cycle of nature.

PAMINA, PAPAGENO
Its high purpose clearly proclaims:
there is nothing nobler than woman and man.
Man and woman, and woman and man,
reach towards the deity.

Exeunt.

Scene change. A grove. Three temples. The "Temple of Wisdom" in the centre, the "Temple of Reason" on the right, the "Temple of Nature" on the left.

The three boys lead Tamino to the temples.

FIRST BOY
Come, Tamino!

TAMINO
Where are you leading me, boys?

FIRST BOY
To the temple of wisdom.


No. 8 - Finale

THE THREE BOYS
This path leads to your goal,
yet you, youth, must conquer like a man.
Therefore listen to our advice:
be constant, patient, and discreet!

TAMINO
You gracious lads, tell me
if I can rescue Pamina?

THE THREE BOYS
This is not for us to tell;
be constant, patient, and discreet!
Remember this, in short, be a man.
Then, youth, you will conquer like a man.

Exeunt.

TAMINO
Let these boys' words of wisdom
be forever engraved on my heart.
Where am I now? What will happen to me?
Is this the seat of the gods here?
The gates show, the pillars show
that prudence and labour and arts live here.
Where activity is enthroned and idleness in retreat,
vice cannot easily hold sway.
I shall boldly dare to enter the gate.
My purpose is noble and true and pure.
Tremble, cowardly villain!
To me, rescuing Pamina is a duty.

He goes to the door of the right-hand temple.

PRIESTS
from within
Go back!

TAMINO
Back? Then I'll try my luck here!
He goes to the door of the left-hand temple.

PRIESTS
from within
Go back!

TAMINO
They're calling "Go back" here as well!
looks round
Here I can see another door,
here perhaps I shall gain an entrance.
He knocks on the middle door, the Speaker appears.

SPEAKER
Bold stranger, where do you wish to go?
What do you seek here in the sanctuary?

TAMINO
That which belongs to love and virtue.

SPEAKER
These are words of high import!
But how will you find these things?
You are not led by love and virtue,
for you are inflamed by death and revenge.

TAMINO
Revenge only on the villain!

SPEAKER
You will surely not find him with us.

TAMINO
Does Sarastro rule in these parts?

SPEAKER
Yes, yes, Sarastro rules here!

TAMINO
Surely not in the Temple of Wisdom?

SPEAKER
He rules here in the Temple of Wisdom.

TAMINO
Then it is all a sham!
He is about to go.

SPEAKER
Are you going again so soon?

TAMINO
Yes, I want to go, glad and free,
and never see your temple!

SPEAKER
Explain yourself to me more closely;
you are taken in by a deception.

TAMINO
Sarastro lives here,
that's quite enough for me.

SPEAKER
If you love your life,
speak, stay there!
Do you hate Sarastro?

TAMINO
I hate him forever, yes!

SPEAKER
Then give me your reasons.

TAMINO
He is an inhuman tyrant!

SPEAKER
Is there proof for what you say?

TAMINO
It is shown by an unhappy woman,
oppressed by grief and woe!

SPEAKER
So a woman has beguiled you?
A woman does little, chatters a great deal.
You, young man, believe the wagging tongues?
Oh, if only Sarastro laid before you
the reason for his action!

TAMINO
The reason is only too clear!
Did not the robber ruthlessly tear
Pamina from her mother's arms?

SPEAKER
Yes, young man! What you say is true.

TAMINO
Where is she whom he stole from us?
Perhaps she has already been sacrificed?

SPEAKER
This information, dear son,
I am not yet permitted to give you now.

TAMINO
Explain this riddle, do not deceive me.

SPEAKER
My tongue is bound by oath and duty.

TAMINO
So when will this obscurity clear?

SPEAKER
As soon as the hand of friendship guides you
into the sanctuary to the everlasting bonds.
Exit.

TAMINO
O endless night! When will you pass?
When will the light strike my eyes?

CHORUS
from within
Soon, soon, young man, or not at all!

TAMINO
Soon, you say, or not at all?
You unseen ones, tell me:
is Pamina then still alive?

CHORUS
Pamina is still alive!

TAMINO
She is alive! For that I thank you.
He takes his flute out.
Oh, if only I were able,
in homage to you, almighty ones,
to show my thanks in every note
as here.
pointing to his heart
Here I feel it!
He plays; wild animals of all kinds come to listen to him. He stops and they flee.

How powerful your magic sound is,
sweet flute, since your playing
brings joy even to wild animals.
Yet only Pamina stays away!
Pamina! Listen, listen to me!
In vain!
Where? Oh, where shall I find you?
He plays, Papageno answers on his pipes from within.
Aha, that is Papageno's sound!
He plays, Papageno answers.
Perhaps he's seen Pamina already.
Perhaps she is hastening to me with him!
Perhaps the sound will lead me to her.

He hurries off. Enter Pamina and Papageno.

PAMINA, PAPAGENO
Swift steps, ready courage,
guard against the enemy's cunning and fury.
If only we could find Tamino!
Otherwise they will catch us yet.

PAMINA
Dear young man!

PAPAGENO
Quiet, quiet, I can do better!
He plays the pipes, Tamino answers from within on his flute.

PAMINA, PAPAGENO
What greater joy could there be?
Our friend Tamino can hear us already.
The sound of the flute has reached here.
What happiness if I find him!
Just hurry! Just hurry!

They try to leave. Enter Monostatos.

MONOSTATOS
Just hurry! Just hurry!
Aha! I've caught you yet!
Here with the steel and irons;
wait, I'll teach you manners.
Deceiving Monostatos!
Here with the ropes and cords!
Hey there, you slaves, come here!

PAMINA, PAPAGENO
Ah, now it's all over for us!

MONOSTATOS
Hey there, you slaves, come here!

Slaves bring chains.

PAPAGENO
Nothing ventured, nothing gained!
Come, you pretty chimes,
make the little bells ring, ring,
till their ears are singing.
He plays on his glockenspiel. Immediately Monostatos and the slaves dance and sing.

MONOSTATOS, SLAVES
That sounds so splendid,
that sounds so pretty!
Lalala la la lalala!
I've never heard or seen the like!
Lalala la la lalala!
They dance off.

PAMINA, PAPAGENO
If every honest man
could find little bells like that,
his enemies would then
vanish without trouble,
and without them he would live
in perfect harmony!
Only the harmony of friendship
relieves hardships;
without this sympathy
there is no happiness on earth!

CHORUS
from within
Long live Sarastro! May Sarastro live long!

PAPAGENO
What does this mean? I'm trembling, I'm shaking!

PAMINA
Oh, my friend, now it's all up with us.
This heralds Sarastro's arrival.

PAPAGENO
Oh, if I were a mouse
how I would hide!
If I were as little as a snail,
I would crawl into my house!
My child, what shall we say now?

PAMINA
The truth, even if it were a crime!

Sarastro - in a triumphal carriage drawn by six lions - makes his entrance with his retinue.

CHORUS
Long live Sarastro, Sarastro shall have long life!
It is he to whom we gladly submit!
In his wisdom may he always enjoy life.
He is our idol, to whom all are devoted.

PAMINA
kneels down before Sarastro
My lord, it is true that I have transgressed,
I wanted to escape from your power.
But the fault is not mine:
the wicked Moor desired my love;
that is why, o lord, I ran away from you!

SARASTRO
Stand up, beloved, be of good cheer!
For even without pressing you,
I know more of your heart;
you love another very dearly.
I do not want to compel you to love,
yet I shall not give you your freedom.

PAMINA
But filial duty calls me,
for my mother ...

SARASTRO
... is in my power.
You would lose your happiness
if I left you in her hands.

PAMINA
My mother's name sounds sweet to me.
She is ...

SARASTRO
... a proud woman!
A man must guide your hearts,
for without him all women tend
to step outside their own sphere of activity.

Monostatos brings Tamino in

MONOSTATOS
Now, proud youth, just come here,
here is Sarastro, our lord.

PAMINA
It is he!

TAMINO
It is she!

PAMINA
I can't believe it!

TAMINO
It is she!

PAMINA
It is he!

TAMINO
It's not a dream!

PAMINA
I'll put my arms around him!

TAMINO
I'll put my arms around her!

PAMINA, TAMINO
Even if it were the end of me!

They embrace.

CHORUS
What is the meaning of this?

MONOSTATOS
What boldness!
Break it up at once! This is going too far!
He separates them, then kneels before Sarastro.
Your slave lies at your feet;
punish the brazen criminal!
Consider how impudent the boy is!
indicating Papageno
Through the cunning of this strange bird
he wanted to abduct Pamina from you.
But I knew how to track him down!
You know me! My vigilance ...

SARASTRO
... deserves to be strewn with laurels.
Here! Give this worthy man at once ...

MONOSTATOS
Your favour alone makes me rich!

SARASTRO
... no more than seventy-seven strokes on his soles.

MONOSTATOS
Ah my lord, that was not the reward I expected!

SARASTRO
Do not thank me! I am only doing my duty!

Monostatos is led off.

CHORUS
Long live Sarastro in his divine wisdom!
He rewards and punishes at one turn.

SARASTRO
Bring these two strangers
into our temple of trial;
then cover their heads,
they must first be purified.

Two priests cover Tamino and Papageno with sacks.

CHORUS
When virtue and justice
strew with fame the path of the great,
then earth is a realm of heaven,
and mortals are like the gods.



ACT TWO

A palm-grove.
Sarastro and the priests enter with solemn tread.

No. 9 - March of the Priests

SARASTRO
You, servants consecrated in the temple of wisdom of the great gods Osiris and Isis, with a clear conscience I declare to you that our gathering today is one of the most important of our time. Tamino, the son of a king, has journeyed to the north gate of our temple. He wishes to tear off his veil of night and look into the sanctuary of great light. To offer him the hand of friendship should be our duty today!

SPEAKER
Does he possess virtue?

SARASTRO
Virtue!

SECOND PRIEST
Discretion too?

SARASTRO
Discretion!

SPEAKER
Is he charitable?

SARASTRO
Charitable! If you think him worthy, follow my example...
I thank you for your assent. The virtuous Pamina has been destined by the gods for Tamino; it was for this reason that I seized her from her mother.

SPEAKER
Great Sarastro, will Tamino also withstand the harsh trials? Remember: he is a prince.

SARASTRO
He is a human being!
Lead Tamino and his companion into the forecourt of the temple.
to the priests
And teach them to recognize the power of the gods!


No. 10 - Aria with Chorus

SARASTRO
O Isis and Osiris, bestow
the spirit of wisdom on this young couple!
You who guide the wanderers' steps,
strengthen them with patience in danger.

CHORUS
Strengthen them with patience in danger.

SARASTRO
Let them see the fruits of trial;
yet if they should go to their deaths,
then reward the bold course of virtue:
receive them into your abode.

CHORUS
Receive them into your abode.

Exit Sarastro followed by the priests.

Scene change. Forecourt of the temple. Night.
Tamino and Papageno are led in by three priests. The priests untie their sacks and withdraw.

TAMINO
A terrible night! Papageno, are you still with me?

PAPAGENO
Certainly!

TAMINO
Where do you think we are?

PAPAGENO
Where? Well, if it were not so dark, I'd gladly tell you, but as it is ...
thunderclap
Help!

TAMINO
What is it?

PAPAGENO
I'm beginning to feel bad about this business!

TAMINO
You sound afraid.

PAPAGENO
Not afraid exactly, just ice cold from the shivers running down my spine.
loud thunderclap
Help!

Enter the priests with torches.

SECOND PRIEST
You strangers. What do you seek, what impels you to penetrate our walls?

TAMINO
Friendship and love.

SPEAKER
Are you ready to risk your life fighting for them?

TAMINO
Yes!

SPEAKER
You will submit to every trial?

TAMINO
Every one!

SPEAKER
Give me your hand!
They clasp hands.
So be it!

SECOND PRIEST
Do you too wish to fight for the love of wisdom, Papageno?

PAPAGENO
Fighting isn't my thing. I don't basically want any wisdom either. I'm a kind of child of nature, taking pleasure in sleep, food and drink; and if it were even possible some time for me to capture a pretty little wife ...

SECOND PRIEST
You will never obtain her unless you submit to our trials.

PAPAGENO
What are these trials?

SECOND PRIEST
Comply with all our laws, even in face of death.

PAPAGENO
I'll stay single!

SECOND PRIEST
But what if Sarastro had set aside for you a girl who was just like you in colouring and dress?

PAPAGENO
It's all the same to me! Like me? Is she young?

SECOND PRIEST
Young and beautiful!

PAPAGENO
And her name?

SECOND PRIEST
Papagena.

PAPAGENO
What? Pa - pa ... ?

SECOND PRIEST
Papagena.

PAPAGENO
Papagena? - I'd like to see her, just out of curiosity.

SECOND PRIEST
You may see her!

PAPAGENO
Yes?

SECOND PRIEST
Yes ...

PAPAGENO
But when I've seen her, I must die? I'll stay single!

SECOND PRIEST
There is a way to see her without having to die, Papageno: if you are sufficiently steadfast not to speak a word with her.

SPEAKER
The gods impose a salutary silence on you, too, Prince: without it you are both lost! You will see Pamina - but never be allowed to speak to her! This is the beginning of your trials.


No. 11 - Duet

FIRST AND SECOND PRIESTS
Beware of womanly wiles:
this is the brotherhood's first duty!
Many a wise man has been beguiled,
has erred and not realized it.
He has found himself abandoned in the end,
his faithfulness repaid with scorn!
In vain he has wrung his hands,
death and despair were his reward.

Exeunt Priests.

PAPAGENO
Hey, lights there! Lights there! That's really strange - whenever these gentlemen leave you, you stop seeing anything, even with your eyes wide open!

The three ladies come through the trapdoor.


No. 12 - Quintet

THE THREE LADIES
What? What? What?
You in this place of horror?
Never, never, never
will you make your escape!
Tamino, your death is sworn!
You, Papageno, are lost!

PAPAGENO
No, no, no! That would be too much!

TAMINO
Papageno, keep quiet!
Do you want to break your oath
not to speak to women here?

PAPAGENO
But you can hear, we've both had it.

TAMINO
Quiet, I say! Keep quiet!

PAPAGENO
Always quiet, always quiet!

THE THREE LADIES
The Queen is quite near you!
She has secretly broken into the temple.

PAPAGENO
What? How's this? Could she be in the temple?

TAMINO
Quiet, I say! Keep quiet!
Will you keep on so impudently
forgetting your sworn duty?

THE THREE LADIES
Tamino, listen! You are lost!
Remember the Queen!
There is much whispering
about these priests' falsehood!

TAMINO
(A wise man cheeks and disregards
the words of the common herd.)

THE THREE LADIES
They say that anyone vowing allegiance to their brotherhood
goes head over heels into hell.

PAPAGENO
That would be unthinkable, by the devil!
Tell me, Tamino, is that true?

TAMINO
Gossip, repeated by women
but invented by dissemblers.

PAPAGENO
Yet the Queen says it too.

TAMINO
She is a woman, with the mind of a woman.
Be quiet, be satisfied with my word,
think of your duty and behave sensibly.

THE THREE LADIES
to Tamino
Why are you being so coy with us?
Tamino indicates that he may not speak.
Papageno too is silent - speak then!

PAPAGENO
covertly to the ladies
I should gladly ... would ...

TAMINO
Quiet!

PAPAGENO
You see that I must not ...

TAMINO
Quiet!

PAPAGENO
My continual chattering
is indeed disgraceful of me!

TAMINO
Your continual chattering
is indeed disgraceful of you!

THE THREE LADIES
To our shame we must leave them;
certainly neither will talk.

TAMINO, PAPAGENO
To their shame they must leave us;
certainly neither will talk.

ALL
A man is strong-minded;
he thinks what he should say.

PRIESTS
from within
The sacred portals are desecrated!
Down to hell with these women!

THE THREE LADIES
Alas!

The three ladies drop through the trapdoor.

PAPAGENO
Alas!

He falls to the ground. Enter the Speaker and Second Priest with torches.

SPEAKER
Tamino! Your steadfastness has triumphed. But you will have many a hard and dangerous path to tread! - Come then!

SECOND PRIEST
Stand up, Papageno! - What are you doing there?

PAPAGENO
Sh!
I'm lying in a faint!

SECOND PRIEST
Up! Pull yourself together, and we'll go on to further trials.

PAPAGENO
But if the gods have ordained a Papagena for me, why do I have to go through so many dangers to win her?

SECOND PRIEST
Come! - My duty is only to lead you the way for you!

Scene change. A garden.
Pamina is asleep in an arbour. The moon shines on her face. Monostatos creeps in.


No. 13 - Aria

MONOSTATOS
Everyone feels the joys of love,
billing and cooing, hugging and kissing;
but I am to forswear love
because a black man is ugly.
Do I not then have a heart?
Am I not flesh and blood?
To live for ever without a wife
would truly be hell-fire.

So, because I am alive, I want
to bill and coo and be amorous!
Dear good moon, forgive me;
a white woman has taken my fancy.
White is beautiful! I must kiss her!
Moon, hide your face from this!
If it should offend you too much,
then close your eyes!

He creeps slowly and quietly towards Pamina. To thunder, the Queen of the Night comes out of the trapdoor.

MONOSTATOS
Help! It's the Queen of the Night; I must hear what she and Pamina say!
hides

PAMINA
waking
Mother! Oh my mother ...

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
Where is the young man I sent you?

PAMINA
Tamino has withdrawn for ever from the world and people. He has gone over to Sarastro!

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
What do I hear? Sarastro has triumphed again. Do you see this blade? It has been sharpened for Sarastro, and you will kill him!


No. 14 - Aria

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
My heart is seething with hellish vengeance,
death and despair are blazing around me!
Unless Sarastro feels the pangs of death at your hands
you are no longer my daughter.
Forever disowned, forever abandoned,
forever destroyed may all ties of nature be,
unless Sarastro dies at your hands!
Hear! Gods of vengeance! Hear a mother's vow!

She gives Pamina the dagger and disappears.

PAMINA
holding the dagger
Am I to commit murder? - No, I cannot! - Gods, what am I to do?

MONOSTATOS
coming out of hiding
Put your trust in me!
takes the dagger from her

PAMINA
You, Monostatos?

MONOSTATOS
What are you trembling about? My black skin - or the murder plan?

PAMINA
You know then ...

MONOSTATOS
Everything ... You have only one way then of saving yourself and your mother ...

PAMINA
And what might that be?

MONOSTATOS
To love me.

PAMINA
No!

MONOSTATOS
Yes or no?

PAMINA
No!

Enter Sarastro.

SARASTRO
Go, Monostatos!

MONOSTATOS
My lord, I am innocent ...

SARASTRO
Go!

Exit Monostatos.

PAMINA
My lord! Great Sarastro, do not punish my mother; the pain of losing me ...

SARASTRO
I know everything. May the heavens grant Tamino courage and steadfastness; then you will be happy with him, and your mother will return to her castle.


No. 15 - Aria

SARASTRO
Within these sacred portals
revenge is unknown,
and if a man has fallen,
love guides him to his duty.
Then, with a friend's hand, he walks,
glad and joyful, into a better land.

Within these sacred walls,
where man loves fellow man,
no traitor can lurk,
because enemies are forgiven.
He who is not gladdened by such teachings
does not deserve to be a man.

Exeunt Sarastro and Pamina.

Scene change. A hall.
Tamino and Papageno are led in by two priests.

SPEAKER
Here you are both left alone to yourselves. - As soon as you have received the order, continue on your way! - Prince, do not forget this word: silence.

SECOND PRIEST
Papageno, whoever breaks silence in this place is punished by the gods with thunder and lightning.

Exeunt priests.

PAPAGENO
after a pause
Tamino!

TAMINO
reproachfully
Sh!

PAPAGENO
This is a jolly life! If I were in my straw hut or in the woods, I could at least hear a bird chirping occasionally!

TAMINO
reproachfully
Sh!

PAPAGENO
Surely I can talk to myself, and the two of us can talk to each other, too - we are men after all.

TAMINO
Sh!

PAPAGENO
There's not even a drop of water to be had from these people, let alone anything else. - Tamino, look who's coming!
An ugly old woman comes out of the trapdoor holding a large cup of water.
Hey, old lady! Is that cup for me?

WOMAN
Yes, my angel!

PAPAGENO
drinks
Water!

WOMAN
Yes, my angel, water.

PAPAGENO
Nothing more or less than water. Come on, old lady, sit here with me. I'm as bored as hell. How old are you then?

WOMAN
Eighteen years and two minutes.

PAPAGENO
Eighteen years and two minutes?

WOMAN
Yes.

PAPAGENO
You look more like a hundred and eighteen. - And do you have a sweetheart as well?

WOMAN
Of course!

PAPAGENO
Is he as young as you?

WOMAN
Not quite, he is ten years older.

PAPAGENO
What is your lover's name then?

WOMAN
Papageno!

PAPAGENO
Papageno! - I'm your sweetheart?

WOMAN
Yes, my angel!

PAPAGENO
taking the water quickly and splashing it in her face
Tell me what your name is?

WOMAN
My name is ...

Loud thunder, the old woman limps quickly off.

PAPAGENO
Thank the gods! The old woman has vanished. Now I shan't say another word!

The three boys descend from above. One has the flute, another the glockenspiel. A well-stocked table appears.


No. 16 - Trio

THE THREE BOYS
Welcome a second time,
you men, in Sarastro's realm.
He sends you what has been taken from you,
the flute and the little bells.
If you would not scorn this fare,
you may happily eat and drink it.
When we meet for the third time
joy will reward your courage!
Tamino, courage! The goal is near.
You, Papageno, keep quiet!

They fly up.

PAPAGENO
Tamino, Tamino, aren't we going to eat?
Tamino plays on his flute.
Just go on blowing your flute! I'll see if the cellar too is well appointed?
He drinks.

PAMINA
joining them
I hear Tamino's flute!
The flute is silent.
You're here, Tamino? I heard your flute and ran towards the sound. - But you are sad? Will you not say a word to your Pamina?
Tamino motions her to go away.
What? I am to keep away from you? Do you love me no more? Oh, this is worse than an offence - worse than death.


No. 17 - Aria

PAMINA
Ah, I sense it has vanished!
The joy of love gone forever!
Hours of delight, you will never come
back to my heart again!
See, Tamino, these tears
are flowing for you alone, beloved.
If you do not feel love's longing
then there will be rest in death!

Exeunt.

Scene change. A vault.
Enter Sarastro and priests.


No. 18 - Priests' Chorus

PRIESTS
O Isis and Osiris, what bliss!
Dark night is banished by the sunlight,
soon the noble youth will feel new life;
soon he will be wholly devoted to our service.
His spirit is bold, his heart is pure,
soon he will be worthy of us.

Tamino is led in by a priest.

SARASTRO
Tamino, your behaviour so far has been steadfast and manly. Now you have two more dangerous paths to travel. - Let Pamina be brought in, blindfold!

Pamina is led in, enveloped in a sack. Sarastro removes the covering from her.

PAMINA
Where am I? The stillness here is dreadful! Tell me, where is Tamino?

SARASTRO
He is waiting for you in order to bid you a last farewell.

PAMINA
A last farewell! Oh, where is he? Tamino!

SARASTRO
He stands before you.


No. 19 - Trio

PAMINA
Am I to see you no more, my dear one?

SARASTRO
You will see each other again with gladness.

PAMINA
Mortal dangers await you!

TAMINO
May the gods preserve me!

SARASTRO
May the gods preserve him!

PAMINA
You will not escape death;
a premonition suggests this to me.

TAMINO, SARASTRO
The will of the gods be done;
their beckoning shall be my/his rule.

PAMINA
Oh, if you loved as I love you,
you would not be so calm.

SARASTRO
Believe me, he shares the same feelings,
and will be faithful to you forever.

TAMINO
Believe me, I share the same feelings,
and shall be faithful to you forever.

SARASTRO
The hour has struck, now you must part.

TAMINO, PAMINA
How bitter are the sorrows of separation!

SARASTRO
Now Tamino must depart again.
The hour has struck, now you must part.

TAMINO
Pamina, I really must depart!
How bitter are the sorrows of separation!

PAMINA
Now Tamino really must depart!
Tamino!

SARASTRO
Now he must depart!

TAMINO
Now I must depart!

PAMINA
You must depart then!

TAMINO
Pamina, farewell!

PAMINA
Tamino, farewell!

SARASTRO
Now make haste.
Your oath calls you.
The hour has struck; we shall meet again.

TAMINO, PAMINA
Oh, golden repose, return!
Farewell, farewell!

They withdraw.

PAPAGENO
from outside
Tamino! Tamino! Are you abandoning me completely?
comes in, searching
If I at least knew where I was!

He goes to the door through which Tamino has been led away. The Speaker confronts him.

SPEAKER
Papageno, you deserve to wander for ever in the dark chasms of the earth! The gracious gods release you from this punishment. However, you will never experience the heavenly delight of the consecrated band.

PAPAGENO
Well now, there are certainly other people like me. - To me the greatest delight at this moment would be a good glass of wine.

A large goblet of red wine emerges from the ground.

SPEAKER
Is that all you want in this world?

PAPAGENO
Hmm - My heart feels quite strange! I should like ... I could wish ... Well, what is it I want then?


No. 20 - Aria

PAPAGENO
A girl or a little wife
is what Papageno desires.
Oh, a sweet little dove like that
would be bliss for me!
Then I should drink and eat with relish,
then I could hold my own with princes,
enjoy life in my wisdom,
and be as if in Elysium.

A girl or a little wife
is what Papageno desires.
Oh, a sweet little dove like that
would be bliss for me!
Ah, can't I find one, then, amongst all
the lovely girls, who would like me?
Let just one help me out of my misery,
or I shall truly die of grief.

A girl or a little wife
is what Papageno desires.
Oh, a sweet little dove like that
would be bliss for me!
If no one will offer me love,
then the fire must consume me,
but if a woman's lips kiss me,
I shall be well again straightaway!

Enter the old woman, dancing and leaning on her stick.

WOMAN
Here I am now, my angel!

PAPAGENO
You have taken pity on me?

WOMAN
Yes, Papageno, and if you promise always to stay faithful to me, then you shall see how tenderly your little wife will love you.

PAPAGENO
Not so fast though, my old angel! An attachment like this needs some thinking about, after all.

WOMAN
Papageno, I advise you not to hesitate! Your hand, or you will be imprisoned here for ever - with only bread and water.

PAPAGENO
Drink water? Live alone? No, in that case I'd rather take you, old woman. Well now, there's my hand on it that I shall always remain true to you (so long as I don't find anyone prettier).

WOMAN
You swear to it?

PAPAGENO
Yes, I swear to it!

The old woman changes into a young girl, dressed just like Papageno.

PAPAGENA
Papageno, look at me!

PAPAGENO
Papagena, how you've changed. You really are eighteen, young, lovely - let me hold you!

He tries to embrace her.

SPEAKER
Get back, Papageno! You are not yet worthy to take this young woman in your arms.

He drags Papagena off. Papageno drops down.

Scene change. A garden
The three boys descend from above.


No. 21 - Finale

THE THREE BOYS
Soon, heralding the morning,
the sun will shine forth on its golden path.
Soon superstition shall vanish,
soon the wise man will triumph.
Oh, sweet repose, descend,
return to the hearts of men;
then earth will be a realm of heaven,
and mortals will be like gods.

FIRST BOY
Yet see, Pamina is racked with despair!

SECOND AND THIRD BOYS
Where is she then?

FIRST BOY
She is out of her senses.

THE THREE BOYS
She is racked by the pain of rejected love.
Let us bring consolation to the poor girl!
Truly, her fate touches us!
Oh, if only her young man were there! -
She is coming! Let us step aside
to see what she will do.

They step aside. Enter Pamina with a dagger in her hand.

PAMINA
to the dagger
You are my bridegroom then?
Through you I shall consummate my grief!

THE THREE BOYS
(What sombre words she has just uttered!
The poor girl is close to madness.)

PAMINA
Patience, my lovel I am yours,
soon we shall be married.

THE THREE BOYS
Madness rages in her mind,
suicide is written in her face. -
to Pamina
Fair maiden, look at us!

PAMINA
I want to die because the man
whom I can never hate
can abandon his sweetheart!
She indicates the dagger
This was given me by my mother.

THE THREE BOYS
God will punish you for suicide.

PAMINA
Better to perish by this steel
than die of love's grief.
Mother, my suffering comes from you,
and your curse pursues me.

THE THREE BOYS
Maiden, will you come with us?

PAMINA
Surely my cup of woe is full!
False youth, farewell!
See, Pamina dies through you.
Let this blade kill me!
is about to stab herself

THE THREE BOYS
holding back her arm
Ah, unhappy girl! Stop!
If your young man were to see this,
he would die of grief;
for he loves only you.

PAMINA
recovering
What? Has he returned my love?
Yet he concealed his feelings from me,
turned his face away from me?
Why would he not speak to me?

THE THREE BOYS
This we must not say,
but we want to show him to you,
and you will be astonished to see
that he has surrendered his heart to you,
and is facing death for you.
Come let us go to him.

PAMINA
Take me there; I would like to see him.

ALL
Two hearts burning with love
can never be divided by human weakness.
Their enemies labour in vain;
the gods themselves protect them.

Exeunt.

Scene change. Two great mountains; in one there is a waterfall, the other pours out fire.
Two men in black armour lead in Tamino.

THE ARMOURED MEN
Whoever walks along this path so full of troubles
is purified by fire, water, air, and earth.
If he can conquer the fear of death,
he will soar from the earth up to heaven.
Enlightened, he will then be able
to devote himself wholly to the mysteries of Isis.

TAMINO
No fear of death shall stop me acting like a man,
continuing to follow the path of virtue.
Open the gates of terror for me;
I'll gladly venture on this bold course.
He is about to go.

PAMINA
in the distance
Tamino, stop! I must see you!

TAMINO
What's this I hear? Pamina's voice?

THE ARMOURED MEN
Yes, yes, that is Pamina's voice.

TAMINO
How fortunate I am, now she can come with me,
now we can no longer be separated by destiny,
even if death were our lot.

THE ARMOURED MEN
How fortunate you are, now she can come with you,
now you can no longer be separated by destiny,
even if death were your lot.

TAMINO
Am I permitted to speak with her?

THE ARMOURED MEN
You are permitted to speak with her!

TAMINO, THE ARMOURED MEN
What joy when we meet each other/you both again.
Going gladly hand in hand into the temple.
A woman unafraid of darkness and death
is worthy and will be consecrated.

Pamina is led in by a priest. Tamino and Pamina embrace.

PAMINA
My Tamino! O what joy!

TAMINO
My Pamina! O what joy!
Here are the gates of terror
which threaten danger and death for me.

PAMINA
Everywhere I shall
be at your side.
I myself shall lead you;
love guides me.
taking him by the hand
Let it strew the path with roses,
for roses always go with thorns.
You play the magic flute;
may it protect us on our way.
One enchanted hour it was carved
by my father out of the deepest heart
of the thousand-year-old oak,
amidst thunder and lightning, storm and tempest.
Now come and play the flute;
let it guide us on our grim path.

PAMINA, TAMINO
By the power of music we walk
cheerfully through the dark night of death!

THE ARMOURED MEN
By the power of music you walk
cheerfully through the dark night of death!

Tamino and Pamina turn towards the mountain which is pouring out fire. They walk through crackling fire and bowling wind. Tamino plays his flute. As soon as they come out of the fire, they embrace.

PAMINA, TAMINO
We have walked through flames,
fought the danger bravely.
May your sound protect us in the floods
as it has in the fire.

Tamino plays the flute. They turn towards the mountain with the waterfall, climb down and come up again some time later. Immediately a temple entrance appears, lit with the utmost brilliance.

PAMINA, TAMINO
You gods, what a moment!
The joy of Isis is granted to us!

CHORUS OF PRIESTS
from within
Victory! Victory! You noble couple!
You have overcome the danger,
the consecration of Isis is now yours,
come, enter the temple!


Scene change. A garden.
Enter Papageno.

PAPAGENO
calling with his panpipe
Papagena, Papagena, Papagena!
Little wife, little dove, my pretty!
No use! Ah, she is lost!
I was born for misfortune.
I have been chattering, and that was wrong,
and so I am getting my deserts.
Ever since I tasted that wine ...
since I saw the pretty little woman,
my little heart has been burning,
with twinges here, twinges there.
Papagena, little wife of my heart!
Papagena, dear little dove!
It's no good, it is useless;
I've had enough of my life!
Death puts an end to love,
however much my heart is on fire.
He takes a rope.
I will grace that tree there,
tie my neck to it;
because life is not to my liking;
good night, false world.
Because you treat me ill,
sending me no pretty child,
it's all over, I shall die.
Pretty girls, think of me.
If in my misery one of you will
yet take pity on me before I hang,
well and good, this time I'll leave it at that!
Just call yes or no!
No one can hear me, everything's quiet!
So is it your will?
Papageno, up there smartly!
Put an end to your life.
Now I'll just wait, let's say
until we've counted one, two, three.
piping
One! ...
Two! ...
Three! ...
Right then! That's still how it is!
Since there is nothing holding me back,
good night, false world!
He goes to hang himself.

THE THREE BOYS
descend
Stop' Papageno, and be sensible;
you have only one life, so let's have no more of this.

PAPAGENO
It's easy for you to talk, it's easy to jest.
Yet if your hearts burned like mine
you too would go after girls.

THE THREE BOYS
Then play your little bells;
this will bring you your little wife.

PAPAGENO
I'm a fool to have forgotten those pieces of magic!
takes out his glockenspiel
Ring, chimes, ring!
I must see my darling girl.
The three boys fetch Papagena.
Tinkle, little bells, tinkle,
fetch me my girl!
Tinkle, little bells, tinkle,
bring me my little wife!

THE THREE BOYS
as they fly up
Now Papageno, look round!

PAPAGENO
Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Papagena!

PAPAGENA
Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Papageno!

PAPAGENO
Are you really all mine now?

PAPAGENA
Now I really am all yours.

PAPAGENO
So now be my darling little wife!

PAPAGENA
So now be the little dove of my heart!

PAPAGENO, PAPAGENA
What a pleasure that will be,
when the gods remember us,
crown our love with children,
such dear little children!

PAPAGENO
First a little Papageno!

PAPAGENA
Then a little Papagena!

PAPAGENO
Then another Papageno!

PAPAGENA
Then another Papagena!

PAPAGENO, PAPAGENA
Papageno! Papagena!
It is the greatest feeling
that many, many
Pa-Pa-Papagenos,
Pa-Pa-Papagenas
may be a blessing to their parents.

Exeunt Papageno and Papagena.
Monostatos and the Queen of the Night with her three ladies emergefrom the trapdoor.

MONOSTATOS
Just keep quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet!
Soon we shall be making our way into the temple.

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT, THE THREE LADIES
Just keep quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet!
Soon we shall be making our way into the temple.

MONOSTATOS
But, Sovereign Lady, keep your word! Fulfil ...
Your daughter must be my wife.

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
I'll keep my word! It is my will.
My daughter shall be your wife.

THE THREE LADIES
Her child shall be your wife.

MONOSTATOS
Quiet though! I hear a terrible roaring,
like the sound of thunder and a waterfall.

QUEEN OF THE NIGHT, THE THREE LADIES
Yes, this roaring is terrible,
like the echo of distant thunder.

MONOSTATOS
Now they are in the temple halls,

ALL
There let us surprise them,
wipe the bigots from the face of the earth
with burning fire and strong sword.

THE THREE LADIES, MONOSTATOS
To you, great Queen of the Night,
we make our offering of vengeance!

thunder, lightning, tempest

ALL
Our strength is shattered, destroyed,
we are all plunged into eternal night!

They disappear.

Scene change. Temple of the Sun.
Sarastro, Tamino and Pamina in priestly apparel, the priests and the three boys appear.

SARASTRO
The sun's rays drive out the night,
destroy the ill-gotten power of the dissemblers!

CHORUS
Hail to you on your consecration!
You have penetrated the night,
thanks be given to you,
Osiris, thanks to you, Isis!
Strength has triumphed, rewarding
beauty and wisdom with an everlasting crown!
