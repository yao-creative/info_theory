Elsinore.ACT ISCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.Enter Francisco and Barnardo, two sentinels.BARNARDO.Who s there?FRANCISCO.Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself.BARNARDO.Long live the King!FRANCISCO.Barnardo?BARNARDO.He.FRANCISCO.You come most carefully upon your hour.BARNARDO. Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.FRANCISCO.For this relief much thanks.  Tis bitter cold,And I am sick at heart.BARNARDO.Have you had quiet guard?FRANCISCO.Not a mouse stirring.BARNARDO.Well, good night.If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.Enter Horatio and Marcellus.FRANCISCO.I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there?HORATIO.Friends to this ground.MARCELLUS.And liegemen to the Dane.FRANCISCO.Give you good night.MARCELLUS.O, farewell, honest soldier, who hath reliev d you?FRANCISCO.Barnardo has my place. Give you good-night.[_Exit._]MARCELLUS.Holla, Barnardo!BARNARDO.Say, what, is Horatio there?HORATIO.A piece of him.BARNARDO.Welcome, Horatio. Welcome, good Marcellus.MARCELLUS.What, has this thing appear d again tonight?BARNARDO.I have seen nothing.MARCELLUS.Horatio says  tis but our fantasy,And will not let belief take hold of himTouching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.Therefore I have entreated him alongWith us to watch the minutes of this night,That if again this apparition comeHe may approve our eyes and speak to it.HORATIO.Tush, tush,  twill not appear.BARNARDO.Sit down awhile,And let us once again assail your ears,That are so fortified against our story,What we two nights have seen.HORATIO.Well, sit we down,And let us hear Barnardo speak of this.BARNARDO.Last night of all,When yond same star that s westward from the pole,Had made his course t illume that part of heavenWhere now it burns, Marcellus and myself,The bell then beating one MARCELLUS.Peace, break thee off. Look where it comes again.Enter Ghost.BARNARDO.In the same figure, like the King that s dead.MARCELLUS.Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.BARNARDO.Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.HORATIO.Most like. It harrows me with fear and wonder.BARNARDOIt would be spoke to.MARCELLUS.Question it, Horatio.HORATIO.What art thou that usurp st this time of night,Together with that fair and warlike formIn which the majesty of buried DenmarkDid sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee speak.MARCELLUS.It is offended.BARNARDO.See, it stalks away.HORATIO.Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak![_Exit Ghost._]MARCELLUS. Tis gone, and will not answer.BARNARDO.How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale.Is not this something more than fantasy?What think you on t?HORATIO.Before my God, I might not this believeWithout the sensible and true avouchOf mine own eyes.MARCELLUS.Is it not like the King?HORATIO.As thou art to thyself:Such was the very armour he had onWhen he th ambitious Norway combated;So frown d he once, when in an angry parleHe smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. Tis strange.MARCELLUS.Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.HORATIO.In what particular thought to work I know not;But in the gross and scope of my opinion,This bodes some strange eruption to our state.MARCELLUS.Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,Why this same strict and most observant watchSo nightly toils the subject of the land,And why such daily cast of brazen cannonAnd foreign mart for implements of war;Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore taskDoes not divide the Sunday from the week.What might be toward, that this sweaty hasteDoth make the night joint-labourer with the day:Who is t that can inform me?HORATIO.That can I;At least, the whisper goes so. Our last King,Whose image even but now appear d to us,Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,Thereto prick d on by a most emulate pride,Dar d to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,For so this side of our known world esteem d him,Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal d compact,Well ratified by law and heraldry,Did forfeit, with his life, all those his landsWhich he stood seiz d of, to the conqueror;Against the which, a moiety competentWas gaged by our King; which had return dTo the inheritance of Fortinbras,Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov nantAnd carriage of the article design d,His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,Of unimproved mettle, hot and full,Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,Shark d up a list of lawless resolutes,For food and diet, to some enterpriseThat hath a stomach in t; which is no other,As it doth well appear unto our state,But to recover of us by strong handAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid landsSo by his father lost. And this, I take it,Is the main motive of our preparations,The source of this our watch, and the chief headOf this post-haste and rummage in the land.BARNARDO.I think it be no other but e en so:Well may it sort that this portentous figureComes armed through our watch so like the KingThat was and is the question of these wars.HORATIO.A mote it is to trouble the mind s eye.In the most high and palmy state of Rome,A little ere the mightiest ulius fell,The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted deadDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,Upon whose influence Neptune s empire stands,Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.And even the like precurse of fierce events,As harbingers preceding still the fatesAnd prologue to the omen coming on,Have heaven and earth together demonstratedUnto our climatures and countrymen.Re-enter Ghost.But, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!I ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,Speak to me.If there be any good thing to be done,That may to thee do ease, and grace to me,Speak to me.If thou art privy to thy country s fate,Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,O speak!Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy lifeExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,Speak of it. Stay, and speak![_The cock crows._]Stop it, Marcellus!MARCELLUS.Shall I strike at it with my partisan?HORATIO.Do, if it will not stand.BARNARDO. Tis here!HORATIO. Tis here![_Exit Ghost._]MARCELLUS. Tis gone!We do it wrong, being so majestical,To offer it the show of violence,For it is as the air, invulnerable,And our vain blows malicious mockery.BARNARDO.It was about to speak, when the cock crew.HORATIO.And then it started, like a guilty thingUpon a fearful summons. I have heardThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throatAwake the god of day; and at his warning,Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,Th extravagant and erring spirit hiesTo his confine. And of the truth hereinThis present object made probation.MARCELLUS.It faded on the crowing of the cock.Some say that ever  gainst that season comesWherein our Saviour s birth is celebrated,The bird of dawning singeth all night long;And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,The nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;So hallow d and so gracious is the time.HORATIO.So have I heard, and do in part believe it.But look, the morn in russet mantle clad,Walks o er the dew of yon high eastward hill.Break we our watch up, and by my advice,Let us impart what we have seen tonightUnto young Hamlet; for upon my life,This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?MARCELLUS.Let s do t, I pray, and I this morning knowWhere we shall find him most conveniently.[_Exeunt._] SCENE II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.Enter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius,Laertes, Voltemand,Cornelius, Lords and Attendant.KING.Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother s deathThe memory be green, and that it us befittedTo bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdomTo be contracted in one brow of woe;Yet so far hath discretion fought with natureThat we with wisest sorrow think on him,Together with remembrance of ourselves.Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,Th imperial jointress to this warlike state,Have we, as  twere with a defeated joy,With one auspicious and one dropping eye,With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,In equal scale weighing delight and dole,Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr dYour better wisdoms, which have freely goneWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.Now follows, that you know young Fortinbras,Holding a weak supposal of our worth,Or thinking by our late dear brother s deathOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,He hath not fail d to pester us with message,Importing the surrender of those landsLost by his father, with all bonds of law,To our most valiant brother. So much for him.Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:Thus much the business is: we have here writTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hearsOf this his nephew s purpose, to suppressHis further gait herein; in that the levies,The lists, and full proportions are all madeOut of his subject: and we here dispatchYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,For bearers of this greeting to old Norway,Giving to you no further personal powerTo business with the King, more than the scopeOf these dilated articles allow.Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.CORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.In that, and all things, will we show our duty.KING.We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.[_Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius._]And now, Laertes, what s the news with you?You told us of some suit. What is t, Laertes?You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,And lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?The head is not more native to the heart,The hand more instrumental to the mouth,Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.What wouldst thou have, Laertes?LAERTES.Dread my lord,Your leave and favour to return to France,From whence though willingly I came to DenmarkTo show my duty in your coronation;Yet now I must confess, that duty done,My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.KING.Have you your father s leave? What says Polonius?POLONIUS.He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leaveBy laboursome petition; and at lastUpon his will I seal d my hard consent.I do beseech you give him leave to go.KING.Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,And thy best graces spend it at thy will!But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son HAMLET.[_Aside._] A little more than kin, and less than kind.KING.How is it that the clouds still hang on you?HAMLET.Not so, my lord, I am too much i  the sun.QUEEN.Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.Do not for ever with thy vailed lidsSeek for thy noble father in the dust.Thou know st  tis common, all that lives must die,Passing through nature to eternity.HAMLET.Ay, madam, it is common.QUEEN.If it be,Why seems it so particular with thee?HAMLET.Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems. Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,Nor customary suits of solemn black,Nor windy suspiration of forc d breath,No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,Nor the dejected haviour of the visage,Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,That can denote me truly. These indeed seem,For they are actions that a man might play;But I have that within which passeth show;These but the trappings and the suits of woe.KING. Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,To give these mourning duties to your father;But you must know, your father lost a father,That father lost, lost his, and the survivor boundIn filial obligation, for some termTo do obsequious sorrow. But to persevereIn obstinate condolement is a courseOf impious stubbornness.  Tis unmanly grief,It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,An understanding simple and unschool d;For what we know must be, and is as commonAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,Why should we in our peevish oppositionTake it to heart? Fie,  tis a fault to heaven,A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,To reason most absurd, whose common themeIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,From the first corse till he that died today, This must be so.  We pray you throw to earthThis unprevailing woe, and think of usAs of a father; for let the world take noteYou are the most immediate to our throne,And with no less nobility of loveThan that which dearest father bears his sonDo I impart toward you. For your intentIn going back to school in Wittenberg,It is most retrograde to our desire:And we beseech you bend you to remainHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.QUEEN.Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.HAMLET.I shall in all my best obey you, madam.KING.Why,  tis a loving and a fair reply.Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;This gentle and unforc d accord of HamletSits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,No jocund health that Denmark drinks todayBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,And the King s rouse the heaven shall bruit again,Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.[_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]HAMLET.O that this too too solid flesh would melt,Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!Or that the Everlasting had not fix dHis canon  gainst self-slaughter. O God! O God!How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitableSeem to me all the uses of this world!Fie on t! Oh fie!  tis an unweeded gardenThat grows to seed; things rank and gross in naturePossess it merely. That it should come to this!But two months dead nay, not so much, not two:So excellent a king; that was to thisHyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,That he might not beteem the winds of heavenVisit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!Must I remember? Why, she would hang on himAs if increase of appetite had grownBy what it fed on; and yet, within a month Let me not think on t Frailty, thy name is woman!A little month, or ere those shoes were oldWith which she followed my poor father s bodyLike Niobe, all tears. Why she, even she O God! A beast that wants discourse of reasonWould have mourn d longer, married with mine uncle,My father s brother; but no more like my fatherThan I to Hercules. Within a month,Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tearsHad left the flushing in her galled eyes,She married. O most wicked speed, to postWith such dexterity to incestuous sheets!It is not, nor it cannot come to good.But break, my heart, for I must hold my tongue.Enter Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo.HORATIO.Hail to your lordship!HAMLET.I am glad to see you well:Horatio, or I do forget myself.HORATIO.The same, my lord,And your poor servant ever.HAMLET.Sir, my good friend;I ll change that name with you:And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?MARCELLUS.My good lord.HAMLET.I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir. But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?HORATIO.A truant disposition, good my lord.HAMLET.I would not hear your enemy say so;Nor shall you do my ear that violence,To make it truster of your own reportAgainst yourself. I know you are no truant.But what is your affair in Elsinore?We ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.HORATIO.My lord, I came to see your father s funeral.HAMLET.I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.I think it was to see my mother s wedding.HORATIO.Indeed, my lord, it follow d hard upon.HAMLET.Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak d meatsDid coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.Would I had met my dearest foe in heavenOr ever I had seen that day, Horatio.My father, methinks I see my father.HORATIO.Where, my lord?HAMLET.In my mind s eye, Horatio.HORATIO.I saw him once; he was a goodly king.HAMLET.He was a man, take him for all in all,I shall not look upon his like again.HORATIO.My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.HAMLET.Saw? Who?HORATIO.My lord, the King your father.HAMLET.The King my father!HORATIO.Season your admiration for a whileWith an attent ear, till I may deliverUpon the witness of these gentlemenThis marvel to you.HAMLET.For God s love let me hear.HORATIO.Two nights together had these gentlemen,Marcellus and Barnardo, on their watchIn the dead waste and middle of the night,Been thus encounter d. A figure like your father,Armed at point exactly, cap- -pie,Appears before them, and with solemn marchGoes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk dBy their oppress d and fear-surprised eyes,Within his truncheon s length; whilst they, distill dAlmost to jelly with the act of fear,Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to meIn dreadful secrecy impart they did,And I with them the third night kept the watch,Where, as they had deliver d, both in time,Form of the thing, each word made true and good,The apparition comes. I knew your father;These hands are not more like.HAMLET.But where was this?MARCELLUS.My lord, upon the platform where we watch.HAMLET.Did you not speak to it?HORATIO.My lord, I did;But answer made it none: yet once methoughtIt lifted up it head, and did addressItself to motion, like as it would speak.But even then the morning cock crew loud,And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,And vanish d from our sight.HAMLET. Tis very strange.HORATIO.As I do live, my honour d lord,  tis true;And we did think it writ down in our dutyTo let you know of it.HAMLET.Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.Hold you the watch tonight?MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.We do, my lord.HAMLET.Arm d, say you?Both.Arm d, my lord.HAMLET.From top to toe?BOTH.My lord, from head to foot.HAMLET.Then saw you not his face?HORATIO.O yes, my lord, he wore his beaver up.HAMLET.What, look d he frowningly?HORATIO.A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.HAMLET.Pale, or red?HORATIO.Nay, very pale.HAMLET.And fix d his eyes upon you?HORATIO.Most constantly.HAMLET.I would I had been there.HORATIO.It would have much amaz d you.HAMLET.Very like, very like. Stay d it long?HORATIO.While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.MARCELLUS and BARNARDO.Longer, longer.HORATIO.Not when I saw t.HAMLET.His beard was grizzled, no?HORATIO.It was, as I have seen it in his life,A sable silver d.HAMLET.I will watch tonight;Perchance  twill walk again.HORATIO.I warrant you it will.HAMLET.If it assume my noble father s person,I ll speak to it, though hell itself should gapeAnd bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,If you have hitherto conceal d this sight,Let it be tenable in your silence still;And whatsoever else shall hap tonight,Give it an understanding, but no tongue.I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well.Upon the platform  twixt eleven and twelve,I ll visit you.ALL.Our duty to your honour.HAMLET.Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.[_Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus and Barnardo._]My father s spirit in arms! All is not well;I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,Though all the earth o erwhelm them, to men s eyes.[_Exit._] SCENE III. A room in Polonius s house.Enter Laertes and Ophelia.LAERTES.My necessaries are embark d. Farewell.And, sister, as the winds give benefitAnd convoy is assistant, do not sleep,But let me hear from you.OPHELIA.Do you doubt that?LAERTES.For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood;A violet in the youth of primy nature,Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;The perfume and suppliance of a minute;No more.OPHELIA.No more but so?LAERTES.Think it no more.For nature crescent does not grow aloneIn thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,The inward service of the mind and soulGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirchThe virtue of his will; but you must fear,His greatness weigh d, his will is not his own;For he himself is subject to his birth:He may not, as unvalu d persons do,Carve for himself; for on his choice dependsThe sanctity and health of this whole state;And therefore must his choice be circumscrib dUnto the voice and yielding of that bodyWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,It fits your wisdom so far to believe itAs he in his particular act and placeMay give his saying deed; which is no furtherThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.Then weigh what loss your honour may sustainIf with too credent ear you list his songs,Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure openTo his unmaster d importunity.Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;And keep you in the rear of your affection,Out of the shot and danger of desire.The chariest maid is prodigal enoughIf she unmask her beauty to the moon.Virtue itself  scapes not calumnious strokes:The canker galls the infants of the springToo oft before their buttons be disclos d,And in the morn and liquid dew of youthContagious blastments are most imminent.Be wary then, best safety lies in fear.Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.OPHELIA.I shall th effect of this good lesson keepAs watchman to my heart. But good my brother,Do not as some ungracious pastors do,Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;Whilst like a puff d and reckless libertineHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads,And recks not his own rede.LAERTES.O, fear me not.I stay too long. But here my father comes.Enter Polonius.A double blessing is a double grace;Occasion smiles upon a second leave.POLONIUS.Yet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame.The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,And you are stay d for. There, my blessing with you.[_Laying his hand on Laertes s head._]And these few precepts in thy memoryLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,Nor any unproportion d thought his act.Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;But do not dull thy palm with entertainmentOf each new-hatch d, unfledg d comrade. BewareOf entrance to a quarrel; but being in,Bear t that th opposed may beware of thee.Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:Take each man s censure, but reserve thy judgement.Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,But not express d in fancy; rich, not gaudy:For the apparel oft proclaims the man;And they in France of the best rank and stationAre of a most select and generous chief in that.Neither a borrower nor a lender be:For loan oft loses both itself and friend;And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.This above all: to thine own self be true;And it must follow, as the night the day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.Farewell: my blessing season this in thee.LAERTES.Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.POLONIUS.The time invites you; go, your servants tend.LAERTES.Farewell, Ophelia, and remember wellWhat I have said to you.OPHELIA. Tis in my memory lock d,And you yourself shall keep the key of it.LAERTES.Farewell.[_Exit._]POLONIUS.What is t, Ophelia, he hath said to you?OPHELIA.So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.POLONIUS.Marry, well bethought: Tis told me he hath very oft of lateGiven private time to you; and you yourselfHave of your audience been most free and bounteous.If it be so, as so  tis put on me,And that in way of caution, I must tell youYou do not understand yourself so clearlyAs it behoves my daughter and your honour.What is between you? Give me up the truth.OPHELIA.He hath, my lord, of late made many tendersOf his affection to me.POLONIUS.Affection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl,Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?OPHELIA.I do not know, my lord, what I should think.POLONIUS.Marry, I ll teach you; think yourself a baby;That you have ta en these tenders for true pay,Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;Or, not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,Running it thus, you ll tender me a fool.OPHELIA.My lord, he hath importun d me with loveIn honourable fashion.POLONIUS.Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.OPHELIA.And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,With almost all the holy vows of heaven.POLONIUS.Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,When the blood burns, how prodigal the soulLends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,Even in their promise, as it is a-making,You must not take for fire. From this timeBe something scanter of your maiden presence;Set your entreatments at a higher rateThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,Believe so much in him that he is young;And with a larger tether may he walkThan may be given you. In few, Ophelia,Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,Not of that dye which their investments show,But mere implorators of unholy suits,Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,The better to beguile. This is for all:I would not, in plain terms, from this time forthHave you so slander any moment leisureAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.Look to t, I charge you; come your ways.OPHELIA.I shall obey, my lord.[_Exeunt._] SCENE IV. The platform.Enter Hamlet, Horatio and Marcellus.HAMLET.The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.HORATIO.It is a nipping and an eager air.HAMLET.What hour now?HORATIO.I think it lacks of twelve.MARCELLUS.No, it is struck.HORATIO.Indeed? I heard it not. It then draws near the seasonWherein the spirit held his wont to walk.[_A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within._]What does this mean, my lord?HAMLET.The King doth wake tonight and takes his rouse,Keeps wassail, and the swaggering upspring reels;And as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray outThe triumph of his pledge.HORATIO.Is it a custom?HAMLET.Ay marry is t;And to my mind, though I am native here,And to the manner born, it is a customMore honour d in the breach than the observance.This heavy-headed revel east and westMakes us traduc d and tax d of other nations:They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phraseSoil our addition; and indeed it takesFrom our achievements, though perform d at height,The pith and marrow of our attribute.So oft it chances in particular menThat for some vicious mole of nature in them,As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty,Since nature cannot choose his origin,By their o ergrowth of some complexion,Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;Or by some habit, that too much o erleavensThe form of plausive manners; that these men,Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,Being Nature s livery or Fortune s star, His virtues else, be they as pure as grace,As infinite as man may undergo,Shall in the general censure take corruptionFrom that particular fault. The dram of evilDoth all the noble substance of a doubtTo his own scandal.HORATIO.Look, my lord, it comes!Enter Ghost.HAMLET.Angels and ministers of grace defend us!Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn d,Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,Be thy intents wicked or charitable,Thou com st in such a questionable shapeThat I will speak to thee. I ll call thee Hamlet,King, father, royal Dane. O, answer me!Let me not burst in ignorance; but tellWhy thy canoniz d bones, hearsed in death,Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn d,Hath op d his ponderous and marble jawsTo cast thee up again! What may this mean,That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,Revisit st thus the glimpses of the moon,Making night hideous, and we fools of natureSo horridly to shake our dispositionWith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?Say, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?[_Ghost beckons Hamlet._]HORATIO.It beckons you to go away with it,As if it some impartment did desireTo you alone.MARCELLUS.Look with what courteous actionIt waves you to a more removed ground.But do not go with it.HORATIO.No, by no means.HAMLET.It will not speak; then will I follow it.HORATIO.Do not, my lord.HAMLET.Why, what should be the fear?I do not set my life at a pin s fee;And for my soul, what can it do to that,Being a thing immortal as itself?It waves me forth again. I ll follow it.HORATIO.What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,Or to the dreadful summit of the cliffThat beetles o er his base into the sea,And there assume some other horrible formWhich might deprive your sovereignty of reason,And draw you into madness? Think of it.The very place puts toys of desperation,Without more motive, into every brainThat looks so many fathoms to the seaAnd hears it roar beneath.HAMLET.It waves me still.Go on, I ll follow thee.MARCELLUS.You shall not go, my lord.HAMLET.Hold off your hands.HORATIO.Be rul d; you shall not go.HAMLET.My fate cries out,And makes each petty artery in this bodyAs hardy as the Nemean lion s nerve.[_Ghost beckons._]Still am I call d. Unhand me, gentlemen.[_Breaking free from them._]By heaven, I ll make a ghost of him that lets me.I say, away! Go on, I ll follow thee.[_Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet._]HORATIO.He waxes desperate with imagination.MARCELLUS.Let s follow;  tis not fit thus to obey him.HORATIO.Have after. To what issue will this come?MARCELLUS.Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.HORATIO.Heaven will direct it.MARCELLUS.Nay, let s follow him.[_Exeunt._] SCENE V. A more remote part of the Castle.Enter Ghost and Hamlet.HAMLET.Whither wilt thou lead me? Speak, I ll go no further.GHOST.Mark me.HAMLET.I will.GHOST.My hour is almost come,When I to sulph rous and tormenting flamesMust render up myself.HAMLET.Alas, poor ghost!GHOST.Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearingTo what I shall unfold.HAMLET.Speak, I am bound to hear.GHOST.So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.HAMLET.What?GHOST.I am thy father s spirit,Doom d for a certain term to walk the night,And for the day confin d to fast in fires,Till the foul crimes done in my days of natureAre burnt and purg d away. But that I am forbidTo tell the secrets of my prison-house,I could a tale unfold whose lightest wordWould harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood,Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,Thy knotted and combined locks to part,And each particular hair to stand on endLike quills upon the fretful porpentine.But this eternal blazon must not beTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!If thou didst ever thy dear father love HAMLET.O God!GHOST.Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.HAMLET.Murder!GHOST.Murder most foul, as in the best it is;But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.HAMLET.Haste me to know t, that I, with wings as swiftAs meditation or the thoughts of loveMay sweep to my revenge.GHOST.I find thee apt;And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weedThat rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear. Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of DenmarkIs by a forged process of my deathRankly abus d; but know, thou noble youth,The serpent that did sting thy father s lifeNow wears his crown.HAMLET.O my prophetic soul!Mine uncle!GHOST.Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts, O wicked wit, and gifts, that have the powerSo to seduce! won to his shameful lustThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.O Hamlet, what a falling off was there,From me, whose love was of that dignityThat it went hand in hand even with the vowI made to her in marriage; and to declineUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poorTo those of mine. But virtue, as it never will be mov d,Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;So lust, though to a radiant angel link d,Will sate itself in a celestial bedAnd prey on garbage.But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,My custom always of the afternoon,Upon my secure hour thy uncle stoleWith juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,And in the porches of my ears did pourThe leperous distilment, whose effectHolds such an enmity with blood of manThat swift as quicksilver it courses throughThe natural gates and alleys of the body;And with a sudden vigour it doth possetAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,The thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;And a most instant tetter bark d about,Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crustAll my smooth body.Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother s hand,Of life, of crown, of queen at once dispatch d:Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,Unhous led, disappointed, unanel d;No reckoning made, but sent to my accountWith all my imperfections on my head.O horrible! O horrible! most horrible!If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;Let not the royal bed of Denmark beA couch for luxury and damned incest.But howsoever thou pursu st this act,Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contriveAgainst thy mother aught; leave her to heaven,And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,And  gins to pale his uneffectual fire.Adieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.[_Exit._]HAMLET.O all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart;And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seatIn this distracted globe. Remember thee?Yea, from the table of my memoryI ll wipe away all trivial fond records,All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,That youth and observation copied there;And thy commandment all alone shall liveWithin the book and volume of my brain,Unmix d with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!O most pernicious woman!O villain, villain, smiling damned villain!My tables. Meet it is I set it down,That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.[_Writing._]So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;It is  Adieu, adieu, remember me. I have sworn t.HORATIO and MARCELLUS.[_Within._] My lord, my lord.MARCELLUS.[_Within._] Lord Hamlet.HORATIO.[_Within._] Heaven secure him.HAMLET.So be it!MARCELLUS.[_Within._] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!HAMLET.Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.Enter Horatio and Marcellus.MARCELLUS.How is t, my noble lord?HORATIO.What news, my lord?HAMLET.O, wonderful!HORATIO.Good my lord, tell it.HAMLET.No, you ll reveal it.HORATIO.Not I, my lord, by heaven.MARCELLUS.Nor I, my lord.HAMLET.How say you then, would heart of man once think it? But you ll be secret?HORATIO and MARCELLUS.Ay, by heaven, my lord.HAMLET.There s ne er a villain dwelling in all DenmarkBut he s an arrant knave.HORATIO.There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the graveTo tell us this.HAMLET.Why, right; you are i  the right;And so, without more circumstance at all,I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:You, as your business and desire shall point you, For every man hath business and desire,Such as it is; and for my own poor part,Look you, I ll go pray.HORATIO.These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.HAMLET.I m sorry they offend you, heartily;Yes faith, heartily.HORATIO.There s no offence, my lord.HAMLET.Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,And much offence too. Touching this vision here,It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.For your desire to know what is between us,O ermaster t as you may. And now, good friends,As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,Give me one poor request.HORATIO.What is t, my lord? We will.HAMLET.Never make known what you have seen tonight.HORATIO and MARCELLUS.My lord, we will not.HAMLET.Nay, but swear t.HORATIO.In faith, my lord, not I.MARCELLUS.Nor I, my lord, in faith.HAMLET.Upon my sword.MARCELLUS.We have sworn, my lord, already.HAMLET.Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.GHOST.[_Cries under the stage._] Swear.HAMLET.Ha, ha boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?Come on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.Consent to swear.HORATIO.Propose the oath, my lord.HAMLET.Never to speak of this that you have seen.Swear by my sword.GHOST.[_Beneath._] Swear.HAMLET._Hic et ubique?_ Then we ll shift our ground.Come hither, gentlemen,And lay your hands again upon my sword.Never to speak of this that you have heard.Swear by my sword.GHOST.[_Beneath._] Swear.HAMLET.Well said, old mole! Canst work i  th earth so fast?A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.HORATIO.O day and night, but this is wondrous strange.HAMLET.And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come,Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,How strange or odd soe er I bear myself, As I perchance hereafter shall think meetTo put an antic disposition on That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,With arms encumber d thus, or this head-shake,Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,As  Well, we know , or  We could and if we would ,Or  If we list to speak ; or  There be and if they might ,Or such ambiguous giving out, to noteThat you know aught of me: this not to do.So grace and mercy at your most need help you,Swear.GHOST.[_Beneath._] Swear.HAMLET.Rest, rest, perturbed spirit. So, gentlemen,With all my love I do commend me to you;And what so poor a man as Hamlet isMay do t express his love and friending to you,God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together,And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.The time is out of joint. O cursed spite,That ever I was born to set it right.Nay, come, let s go together.[_Exeunt._]ACT IISCENE I. A room in Polonius s house.Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.POLONIUS.Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.REYNALDO.I will, my lord.POLONIUS.You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,Before you visit him, to make inquiryOf his behaviour.REYNALDO.My lord, I did intend it.POLONIUS.Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,What company, at what expense; and findingBy this encompassment and drift of question,That they do know my son, come you more nearerThan your particular demands will touch it.Take you as  twere some distant knowledge of him,As thus,  I know his father and his friends,And in part him do you mark this, Reynaldo?REYNALDO.Ay, very well, my lord.POLONIUS. And in part him, but,  you may say,  not well;But if t be he I mean, he s very wild;Addicted so and so;  and there put on himWhat forgeries you please; marry, none so rankAs may dishonour him; take heed of that;But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slipsAs are companions noted and most knownTo youth and liberty.REYNALDO.As gaming, my lord?POLONIUS.Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing,Quarrelling, drabbing. You may go so far.REYNALDO.My lord, that would dishonour him.POLONIUS.Faith no, as you may season it in the charge.You must not put another scandal on him,That he is open to incontinency;That s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintlyThat they may seem the taints of liberty;The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,A savageness in unreclaimed blood,Of general assault.REYNALDO.But my good lord POLONIUS.Wherefore should you do this?REYNALDO.Ay, my lord, I would know that.POLONIUS.Marry, sir, here s my drift,And I believe it is a fetch of warrant.You laying these slight sullies on my son,As  twere a thing a little soil d i  th  working,Mark you,Your party in converse, him you would sound,Having ever seen in the prenominate crimesThe youth you breathe of guilty, be assur dHe closes with you in this consequence; Good sir,  or so; or  friend,  or  gentleman According to the phrase or the additionOf man and country.REYNALDO.Very good, my lord.POLONIUS.And then, sir, does he this, He does What was I about to say?By the mass, I was about to say something. Where did I leave?REYNALDO.At  closes in the consequence. At  friend or so,  and  gentleman. POLONIUS.At  closes in the consequence  ay, marry!He closes with you thus:  I know the gentleman,I saw him yesterday, or t other day,Or then, or then, with such and such; and, as you say,There was he gaming, there o ertook in s rouse,There falling out at tennis : or perchance, I saw him enter such a house of sale _Videlicet_, a brothel, or so forth. See you now;Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth;And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,With windlasses, and with assays of bias,By indirections find directions out.So by my former lecture and adviceShall you my son. You have me, have you not?REYNALDO.My lord, I have.POLONIUS.God b  wi  you, fare you well.REYNALDO.Good my lord.POLONIUS.Observe his inclination in yourself.REYNALDO.I shall, my lord.POLONIUS.And let him ply his music.REYNALDO.Well, my lord.POLONIUS.Farewell.[_Exit Reynaldo._]Enter Ophelia.How now, Ophelia, what s the matter?OPHELIA.Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted.POLONIUS.With what, in the name of God?OPHELIA.My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbrac d,No hat upon his head, his stockings foul d,Ungart red, and down-gyved to his ankle,Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,And with a look so piteous in purportAs if he had been loosed out of hellTo speak of horrors, he comes before me.POLONIUS.Mad for thy love?OPHELIA.My lord, I do not know, but truly I do fear it.POLONIUS.What said he?OPHELIA.He took me by the wrist and held me hard;Then goes he to the length of all his arm;And with his other hand thus o er his brow,He falls to such perusal of my faceAs he would draw it. Long stay d he so,At last, a little shaking of mine arm,And thrice his head thus waving up and down,He rais d a sigh so piteous and profoundAs it did seem to shatter all his bulkAnd end his being. That done, he lets me go,And with his head over his shoulder turn dHe seem d to find his way without his eyes,For out o  doors he went without their help,And to the last bended their light on me.POLONIUS.Come, go with me. I will go seek the King.This is the very ecstasy of love,Whose violent property fordoes itself,And leads the will to desperate undertakings,As oft as any passion under heavenThat does afflict our natures. I am sorry, What, have you given him any hard words of late?OPHELIA.No, my good lord; but as you did command,I did repel his letters and deniedHis access to me.POLONIUS.That hath made him mad.I am sorry that with better heed and judgementI had not quoted him. I fear d he did but trifle,And meant to wreck thee. But beshrew my jealousy!It seems it is as proper to our ageTo cast beyond ourselves in our opinionsAs it is common for the younger sortTo lack discretion. Come, go we to the King.This must be known, which, being kept close, might moveMore grief to hide than hate to utter love.[_Exeunt._] SCENE II. A room in the Castle.Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and Attendants.KING.Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.Moreover that we much did long to see you,The need we have to use you did provokeOur hasty sending. Something have you heardOf Hamlet s transformation; so I call it,Since nor th exterior nor the inward manResembles that it was. What it should be,More than his father s death, that thus hath put himSo much from th understanding of himself,I cannot dream of. I entreat you bothThat, being of so young days brought up with him,And since so neighbour d to his youth and humour,That you vouchsafe your rest here in our courtSome little time, so by your companiesTo draw him on to pleasures and to gather,So much as from occasion you may glean,Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thusThat, open d, lies within our remedy.QUEEN.Good gentlemen, he hath much talk d of you,And sure I am, two men there are not livingTo whom he more adheres. If it will please youTo show us so much gentry and good willAs to expend your time with us awhile,For the supply and profit of our hope,Your visitation shall receive such thanksAs fits a king s remembrance.ROSENCRANTZ.Both your majestiesMight, by the sovereign power you have of us,Put your dread pleasures more into commandThan to entreaty.GUILDENSTERN.We both obey,And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,To lay our service freely at your feetTo be commanded.KING.Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.QUEEN.Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz.And I beseech you instantly to visitMy too much changed son. Go, some of you,And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.GUILDENSTERN.Heavens make our presence and our practicesPleasant and helpful to him.QUEEN.Ay, amen.[_Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and some Attendants._]Enter Polonius.POLONIUS.Th ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,Are joyfully return d.KING.Thou still hast been the father of good news.POLONIUS.Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,Both to my God and to my gracious King:And I do think, or else this brain of mineHunts not the trail of policy so sureAs it hath us d to do that I have foundThe very cause of Hamlet s lunacy.KING.O speak of that, that do I long to hear.POLONIUS.Give first admittance to th ambassadors;My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.KING.Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.[_Exit Polonius._]He tells me, my sweet queen, that he hath foundThe head and source of all your son s distemper.QUEEN.I doubt it is no other but the main,His father s death and our o erhasty marriage.KING.Well, we shall sift him.Enter Polonius with Voltemand and Cornelius.Welcome, my good friends!Say, Voltemand, what from our brother Norway?VOLTEMAND.Most fair return of greetings and desires.Upon our first, he sent out to suppressHis nephew s levies, which to him appear dTo be a preparation  gainst the Polack;But better look d into, he truly foundIt was against your Highness; whereat griev d,That so his sickness, age, and impotenceWas falsely borne in hand, sends out arrestsOn Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys,Receives rebuke from Norway; and in fine,Makes vow before his uncle never moreTo give th assay of arms against your Majesty.Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,And his commission to employ those soldiersSo levied as before, against the Polack:With an entreaty, herein further shown,[_Gives a paper._]That it might please you to give quiet passThrough your dominions for this enterprise,On such regards of safety and allowanceAs therein are set down.KING.It likes us well;And at our more consider d time we ll read,Answer, and think upon this business.Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour.Go to your rest, at night we ll feast together:.Most welcome home.[_Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius._]POLONIUS.This business is well ended.My liege and madam, to expostulateWhat majesty should be, what duty is,Why day is day, night night, and time is timeWere nothing but to waste night, day and time.Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,I will be brief. Your noble son is mad.Mad call I it; for to define true madness,What is t but to be nothing else but mad?But let that go.QUEEN.More matter, with less art.POLONIUS.Madam, I swear I use no art at all.That he is mad,  tis true:  tis true  tis pity;And pity  tis  tis true. A foolish figure,But farewell it, for I will use no art.Mad let us grant him then. And now remainsThat we find out the cause of this effect,Or rather say, the cause of this defect,For this effect defective comes by cause.Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend,I have a daughter have whilst she is mine Who in her duty and obedience, mark,Hath given me this. Now gather, and surmise.[_Reads._]_To the celestial, and my soul s idol, the most beautified Ophelia_ That s an ill phrase, a vile phrase;  beautified  is a vilephrase: but you shall hear.[_Reads._]_these; in her excellent white bosom, these, c._QUEEN.Came this from Hamlet to her?POLONIUS.Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.[_Reads._]  _Doubt thou the stars are fire,     Doubt that the sun doth move,   Doubt truth to be a liar,     But never doubt I love.O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers. I have not art to reckon mygroans. But that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.  Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,     HAMLET._This in obedience hath my daughter show d me;And more above, hath his solicitings,As they fell out by time, by means, and place,All given to mine ear.KING.But how hath she receiv d his love?POLONIUS.What do you think of me?KING.As of a man faithful and honourable.POLONIUS.I would fain prove so. But what might you think,When I had seen this hot love on the wing,As I perceiv d it, I must tell you that,Before my daughter told me, what might you,Or my dear Majesty your queen here, think,If I had play d the desk or table-book,Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,Or look d upon this love with idle sight,What might you think? No, I went round to work,And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star.This must not be.  And then I precepts gave her,That she should lock herself from his resort,Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.Which done, she took the fruits of my advice,And he, repulsed, a short tale to make Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,Into the madness wherein now he raves,And all we wail for.KING.Do you think  tis this?QUEEN.It may be, very likely.POLONIUS.Hath there been such a time, I d fain know that,That I have positively said  Tis so, When it prov d otherwise?KING.Not that I know.POLONIUS.Take this from this, if this be otherwise.[_Points to his head and shoulder._]If circumstances lead me, I will findWhere truth is hid, though it were hid indeedWithin the centre.KING.How may we try it further?POLONIUS.You know sometimes he walks four hours togetherHere in the lobby.QUEEN.So he does indeed.POLONIUS.At such a time I ll loose my daughter to him.Be you and I behind an arras then,Mark the encounter. If he love her not,And be not from his reason fall n thereon,Let me be no assistant for a state,But keep a farm and carters.KING.We will try it.Enter Hamlet, reading.QUEEN.But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.POLONIUS.Away, I do beseech you, both awayI ll board him presently. O, give me leave.[_Exeunt King, Queen and Attendants._]How does my good Lord Hamlet?HAMLET.Well, God-a-mercy.POLONIUS.Do you know me, my lord?HAMLET.Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.POLONIUS.Not I, my lord.HAMLET.Then I would you were so honest a man.POLONIUS.Honest, my lord?HAMLET.Ay sir, to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked outof ten thousand.POLONIUS.That s very true, my lord.HAMLET.For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissingcarrion, Have you a daughter?POLONIUS.I have, my lord.HAMLET.Let her not walk i  th  sun. Conception is a blessing, but not as yourdaughter may conceive. Friend, look to t.POLONIUS.How say you by that? [_Aside._] Still harping on my daughter. Yet heknew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger. He is far gone, fargone. And truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; verynear this. I ll speak to him again. What do you read, my lord?HAMLET.Words, words, words.POLONIUS.What is the matter, my lord?HAMLET.Between who?POLONIUS.I mean the matter that you read, my lord.HAMLET.Slanders, sir. For the satirical slave says here that old men have greybeards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amberand plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, togetherwith most weak hams. All which, sir, though I most powerfully andpotently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down.For you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab you couldgo backward.POLONIUS.[_Aside._] Though this be madness, yet there is method in t. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?HAMLET.Into my grave?POLONIUS.Indeed, that is out o  the air. [_Aside._] How pregnant sometimes hisreplies are! A happiness that often madness hits on, which reason andsanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him andsuddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter.My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.HAMLET.You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more willingly partwithal, except my life, except my life, except my life.POLONIUS.Fare you well, my lord.HAMLET.These tedious old fools.Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.POLONIUS.You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.ROSENCRANTZ.[_To Polonius._] God save you, sir.[_Exit Polonius._]GUILDENSTERN.My honoured lord!ROSENCRANTZ.My most dear lord!HAMLET.My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,Rosencrantz. Good lads, how do ye both?ROSENCRANTZ.As the indifferent children of the earth.GUILDENSTERN.Happy in that we are not over-happy;On Fortune s cap we are not the very button.HAMLET.Nor the soles of her shoe?ROSENCRANTZ.Neither, my lord.HAMLET.Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?GUILDENSTERN.Faith, her privates we.HAMLET.In the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What sthe news?ROSENCRANTZ.None, my lord, but that the world s grown honest.HAMLET.Then is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me question morein particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands ofFortune, that she sends you to prison hither?GUILDENSTERN.Prison, my lord?HAMLET.Denmark s a prison.ROSENCRANTZ.Then is the world one.HAMLET.A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons,Denmark being one o  th  worst.ROSENCRANTZ.We think not so, my lord.HAMLET.Why, then  tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad butthinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.ROSENCRANTZ.Why, then your ambition makes it one;  tis too narrow for your mind.HAMLET.O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king ofinfinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.GUILDENSTERN.Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of theambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.HAMLET.A dream itself is but a shadow.ROSENCRANTZ.Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it isbut a shadow s shadow.HAMLET.Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch d heroesthe beggars  shadows. Shall we to th  court? For, by my fay, I cannotreason.ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.We ll wait upon you.HAMLET.No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for,to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But,in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?ROSENCRANTZ.To visit you, my lord, no other occasion.HAMLET.Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. And sure,dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sentfor? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, dealjustly with me. Come, come; nay, speak.GUILDENSTERN.What should we say, my lord?HAMLET.Why, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is akind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craftenough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.ROSENCRANTZ.To what end, my lord?HAMLET.That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of ourfellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of ourever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer couldcharge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sentfor or no.ROSENCRANTZ.[_To Guildenstern._] What say you?HAMLET.[_Aside._] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold notoff.GUILDENSTERN.My lord, we were sent for.HAMLET.I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery,and your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have oflate, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all customof exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition thatthis goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; thismost excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o erhangingfirmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, itappears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation ofvapours. What a piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinitein faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable; in actionhow like an angel, in apprehension, how like a god: the beauty of theworld, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is thisquintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman neither,though by your smiling you seem to say so.ROSENCRANTZ.My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.HAMLET.Why did you laugh then, when I said  Man delights not me ?ROSENCRANTZ.To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainmentthe players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, andhither are they coming to offer you service.HAMLET.He that plays the king shall be welcome, his Majesty shall have tributeof me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lovershall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace;the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o  th  sere;and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall haltfor t. What players are they?ROSENCRANTZ.Even those you were wont to take such delight in the tragedians of thecity.HAMLET.How chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation andprofit, was better both ways.ROSENCRANTZ.I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.HAMLET.Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Arethey so followed?ROSENCRANTZ.No, indeed, they are not.HAMLET.How comes it? Do they grow rusty?ROSENCRANTZ.Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, anaerie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question,and are most tyrannically clapped for t. These are now the fashion, andso berattle the common stages so they call them that many wearingrapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.HAMLET.What, are they children? Who maintains  em? How are they escoted? Willthey pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not sayafterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players as it ismost like, if their means are no better their writers do them wrong tomake them exclaim against their own succession?ROSENCRANTZ.Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds itno sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for a while, no moneybid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in thequestion.HAMLET.Is t possible?GUILDENSTERN.O, there has been much throwing about of brains.HAMLET.Do the boys carry it away?ROSENCRANTZ.Ay, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.HAMLET.It is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those thatwould make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty,fifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little.  Sblood,there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could findit out.[_Flourish of trumpets within._]GUILDENSTERN.There are the players.HAMLET.Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. Theappurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with youin this garb, lest my extent to the players, which I tell you must showfairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. Youare welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.GUILDENSTERN.In what, my dear lord?HAMLET.I am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know ahawk from a handsaw.Enter Polonius.POLONIUS.Well be with you, gentlemen.HAMLET.Hark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. That greatbaby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.ROSENCRANTZ.Happily he s the second time come to them; for they say an old man istwice a child.HAMLET.I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it. You sayright, sir: for a Monday morning  twas so indeed.POLONIUS.My lord, I have news to tell you.HAMLET.My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome POLONIUS.The actors are come hither, my lord.HAMLET.Buzz, buzz.POLONIUS.Upon my honour.HAMLET.Then came each actor on his ass POLONIUS.The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history,pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poemunlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light, for thelaw of writ and the liberty. These are the only men.HAMLET.O ephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!POLONIUS.What treasure had he, my lord?HAMLET.Why     One fair daughter, and no more,   The which he loved passing well. POLONIUS.[_Aside._] Still on my daughter.HAMLET.Am I not i  th  right, old ephthah?POLONIUS.If you call me ephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passingwell.HAMLET.Nay, that follows not.POLONIUS.What follows then, my lord?HAMLET.Why,   As by lot, God wot,and then, you know,   It came to pass, as most like it was.The first row of the pious chanson will show you more. For look wheremy abridgement comes.Enter four or five Players.You are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well.Welcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc d since Isaw thee last. Com st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young ladyand mistress! By r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when Isaw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God your voice, like apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, youare all welcome. We ll e en to t like French falconers, fly at anythingwe see. We ll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of yourquality. Come, a passionate speech.FIRST PLAYER.What speech, my lord?HAMLET.I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if itwas, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million, twas caviare to the general. But it was as I received it, and others,whose judgements in such matters cried in the top of mine an excellentplay, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty ascunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to makethe matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite theauthor of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome assweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, Ichiefly loved.  Twas Aeneas  tale to Dido, and thereabout of itespecially where he speaks of Priam s slaughter. If it live in yourmemory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see:   _The rugged Pyrrhus, like th  Hyrcanian beast, _It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus    _The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,   Black as his purpose, did the night resemble   When he lay couched in the ominous horse,   Hath now this dread and black complexion smear d   With heraldry more dismal. Head to foot   Now is he total gules, horridly trick d   With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,   Bak d and impasted with the parching streets,   That lend a tyrannous and a damned light   To their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,   And thus o ersized with coagulate gore,   With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus   Old grandsire Priam seeks._So, proceed you.POLONIUS. Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.FIRST PLAYER.   _Anon he finds him,   Striking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,   Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,   Repugnant to command. Unequal match d,   Pyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;   But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword   Th unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,   Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top   Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash   Takes prisoner Pyrrhus  ear. For lo, his sword,   Which was declining on the milky head   Of reverend Priam, seem d i  th air to stick.   So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,   And like a neutral to his will and matter,   Did nothing.   But as we often see against some storm,   A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,   The bold winds speechless, and the orb below   As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder   Doth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus  pause,   Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work,   And never did the Cyclops  hammers fall   On Mars s armour, forg d for proof eterne,   With less remorse than Pyrrhus  bleeding sword   Now falls on Priam.   Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,   In general synod, take away her power;   Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,   And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,   As low as to the fiends._POLONIUS.This is too long.HAMLET.It shall to the barber s, with your beard. Prithee say on.He s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.Say on; come to Hecuba.FIRST PLAYER.   _But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen, _HAMLET. The mobled queen ?POLONIUS.That s good!  Mobled queen  is good.FIRST PLAYER.   _Run barefoot up and down, threat ning the flames   With bisson rheum. A clout upon that head   Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,   About her lank and all o erteemed loins,   A blanket, in th alarm of fear caught up    Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep d,    Gainst Fortune s state would treason have pronounc d.   But if the gods themselves did see her then,   When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport   In mincing with his sword her husband s limbs,   The instant burst of clamour that she made,    Unless things mortal move them not at all,    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,   And passion in the gods._POLONIUS.Look, where he has not turn d his colour, and has tears in s eyes. Prayyou, no more.HAMLET. Tis well. I ll have thee speak out the rest of this soon. Good mylord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them bewell used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time.After your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their illreport while you live.POLONIUS.My lord, I will use them according to their desert.HAMLET.God s bodikin, man, much better. Use every man after his desert, and whoshould  scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity. Theless they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.POLONIUS.Come, sirs.HAMLET.Follow him, friends. We ll hear a play tomorrow.[_Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First._]Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play _The Murder of Gonzago_?FIRST PLAYER.Ay, my lord.HAMLET.We ll ha t tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of somedozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in t, couldyou not?FIRST PLAYER.Ay, my lord.HAMLET.Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.[_Exit First Player._][_To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern_] My good friends, I ll leave youtill night. You are welcome to Elsinore.ROSENCRANTZ.Good my lord.[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]HAMLET.Ay, so, God b  wi  ye. Now I am alone.O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!Is it not monstrous that this player here,But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,Could force his soul so to his own conceitThat from her working all his visage wan d;Tears in his eyes, distraction in s aspect,A broken voice, and his whole function suitingWith forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!For Hecuba?What s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,That he should weep for her? What would he do,Had he the motive and the cue for passionThat I have? He would drown the stage with tearsAnd cleave the general ear with horrid speech;Make mad the guilty, and appal the free,Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peakLike ohn-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,And can say nothing. No, not for a kingUpon whose property and most dear lifeA damn d defeat was made. Am I a coward?Who calls me villain, breaks my pate across?Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?Tweaks me by the nose, gives me the lie i  th  throatAs deep as to the lungs? Who does me this?Ha!  Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot beBut I am pigeon-liver d, and lack gallTo make oppression bitter, or ere thisI should have fatted all the region kitesWith this slave s offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!Oh vengeance!Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,That I, the son of a dear father murder d,Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with wordsAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,A scullion! Fie upon t! Foh!About, my brain! I have heardThat guilty creatures sitting at a play,Have by the very cunning of the scene,Been struck so to the soul that presentlyThey have proclaim d their malefactions.For murder, though it have no tongue, will speakWith most miraculous organ. I ll have these playersPlay something like the murder of my fatherBefore mine uncle. I ll observe his looks;I ll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,I know my course. The spirit that I have seenMay be the devil, and the devil hath powerT assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhapsOut of my weakness and my melancholy,As he is very potent with such spirits,Abuses me to damn me. I ll have groundsMore relative than this. The play s the thingWherein I ll catch the conscience of the King.[_Exit._]ACT IIISCENE I. A room in the Castle.Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.KING.And can you by no drift of circumstanceGet from him why he puts on this confusion,Grating so harshly all his days of quietWith turbulent and dangerous lunacy?ROSENCRANTZ.He does confess he feels himself distracted,But from what cause he will by no means speak.GUILDENSTERN.Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,But with a crafty madness keeps aloofWhen we would bring him on to some confessionOf his true state.QUEEN.Did he receive you well?ROSENCRANTZ.Most like a gentleman.GUILDENSTERN.But with much forcing of his disposition.ROSENCRANTZ.Niggard of question, but of our demands,Most free in his reply.QUEEN.Did you assay him to any pastime?ROSENCRANTZ.Madam, it so fell out that certain playersWe o er-raught on the way. Of these we told him,And there did seem in him a kind of joyTo hear of it. They are about the court,And, as I think, they have already orderThis night to play before him.POLONIUS. Tis most true;And he beseech d me to entreat your MajestiesTo hear and see the matter.KING.With all my heart; and it doth much content meTo hear him so inclin d.Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,And drive his purpose on to these delights.ROSENCRANTZ.We shall, my lord.[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]KING.Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,That he, as  twere by accident, may hereAffront Ophelia.Her father and myself, lawful espials,Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen,We may of their encounter frankly judge,And gather by him, as he is behav d,If t be th affliction of his love or noThat thus he suffers for.QUEEN.I shall obey you.And for your part, Ophelia, I do wishThat your good beauties be the happy causeOf Hamlet s wildness: so shall I hope your virtuesWill bring him to his wonted way again,To both your honours.OPHELIA.Madam, I wish it may.[_Exit Queen._]POLONIUS.Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,We will bestow ourselves. [_To Ophelia._] Read on this book,That show of such an exercise may colourYour loneliness. We are oft to blame in this, Tis too much prov d, that with devotion s visageAnd pious action we do sugar o erThe devil himself.KING.[_Aside._] O  tis too true!How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!The harlot s cheek, beautied with plastering art,Is not more ugly to the thing that helps itThan is my deed to my most painted word.O heavy burden!POLONIUS.I hear him coming. Let s withdraw, my lord.[_Exeunt King and Polonius._]Enter Hamlet.HAMLET.To be, or not to be, that is the question:Whether  tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,And by opposing end them? To die to sleep,No more; and by a sleep to say we endThe heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocksThat flesh is heir to:  tis a consummationDevoutly to be wish d. To die, to sleep.To sleep, perchance to dream ay, there s the rub,For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause. There s the respectThat makes calamity of so long life.For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,The oppressor s wrong, the proud man s contumely,The pangs of dispriz d love, the law s delay,The insolence of office, and the spurnsThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,When he himself might his quietus makeWith a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,To grunt and sweat under a weary life,But that the dread of something after death,The undiscover d country, from whose bournNo traveller returns, puzzles the will,And makes us rather bear those ills we haveThan fly to others that we know not of?Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,And thus the native hue of resolutionIs sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought,And enterprises of great pith and moment,With this regard their currents turn awryAnd lose the name of action. Soft you now,The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisonsBe all my sins remember d.OPHELIA.Good my lord,How does your honour for this many a day?HAMLET.I humbly thank you; well, well, well.OPHELIA.My lord, I have remembrances of yoursThat I have longed long to re-deliver.I pray you, now receive them.HAMLET.No, not I.I never gave you aught.OPHELIA.My honour d lord, you know right well you did,And with them words of so sweet breath compos dAs made the things more rich; their perfume lost,Take these again; for to the noble mindRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.There, my lord.HAMLET.Ha, ha! Are you honest?OPHELIA.My lord?HAMLET.Are you fair?OPHELIA.What means your lordship?HAMLET.That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourseto your beauty.OPHELIA.Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?HAMLET.Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty fromwhat it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beautyinto his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time givesit proof. I did love you once.OPHELIA.Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.HAMLET.You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our oldstock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.OPHELIA.I was the more deceived.HAMLET.Get thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I ammyself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such thingsthat it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud,revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I havethoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to actthem in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth andheaven? We are arrant knaves all, believe none of us. Go thy ways to anunnery. Where s your father?OPHELIA.At home, my lord.HAMLET.Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere butin s own house. Farewell.OPHELIA.O help him, you sweet heavens!HAMLET.If thou dost marry, I ll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thouas chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Getthee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry afool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. Toa nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell.OPHELIA.O heavenly powers, restore him!HAMLET.I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you oneface, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and youlisp, and nickname God s creatures, and make your wantonness yourignorance. Go to, I ll no more on t, it hath made me mad. I say, wewill have no more marriages. Those that are married already, all butone, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.[_Exit._]OPHELIA.O, what a noble mind is here o erthrown!The courtier s, soldier s, scholar s, eye, tongue, sword,Th expectancy and rose of the fair state,The glass of fashion and the mould of form,Th observ d of all observers, quite, quite down!And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,That suck d the honey of his music vows,Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,Like sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh,That unmatch d form and feature of blown youthBlasted with ecstasy. O woe is me,T have seen what I have seen, see what I see.Enter King and Polonius.KING.Love? His affections do not that way tend,Nor what he spake, though it lack d form a little,Was not like madness. There s something in his soulO er which his melancholy sits on brood,And I do doubt the hatch and the discloseWill be some danger, which for to prevent,I have in quick determinationThus set it down: he shall with speed to EnglandFor the demand of our neglected tribute:Haply the seas and countries different,With variable objects, shall expelThis something settled matter in his heart,Whereon his brains still beating puts him thusFrom fashion of himself. What think you on t?POLONIUS.It shall do well. But yet do I believeThe origin and commencement of his griefSprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia?You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said,We heard it all. My lord, do as you please,But if you hold it fit, after the play,Let his queen mother all alone entreat himTo show his grief, let her be round with him,And I ll be plac d, so please you, in the earOf all their conference. If she find him not,To England send him; or confine him whereYour wisdom best shall think.KING.It shall be so.Madness in great ones must not unwatch d go.[_Exeunt._] SCENE II. A hall in the Castle.Enter Hamlet and certain Players.HAMLET.Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly onthe tongue. But if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had aslief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too muchwith your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent,tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of passion, you must acquire andbeget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to thesoul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion totatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who, forthe most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows andnoise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o erdoing Termagant. Itout-Herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.FIRST PLAYER.I warrant your honour.HAMLET.Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor.Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this specialobservance, that you o erstep not the modesty of nature; for anythingso overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at thefirst and now, was and is, to hold as  twere the mirror up to nature;to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very ageand body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or cometardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make thejudicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowanceo erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I haveseen play and heard others praise, and that highly not to speak itprofanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gaitof Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I havethought some of Nature s journeymen had made men, and not made themwell, they imitated humanity so abominably.FIRST PLAYER.I hope we have reform d that indifferently with us, sir.HAMLET.O reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak nomore than is set down for them. For there be of them that willthemselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laughtoo, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be thento be considered. That s villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambitionin the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.[_Exeunt Players._]Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.How now, my lord?Will the King hear this piece of work?POLONIUS.And the Queen too, and that presently.HAMLET.Bid the players make haste.[_Exit Polonius._]Will you two help to hasten them?ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.We will, my lord.[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]HAMLET.What ho, Horatio!Enter Horatio.HORATIO.Here, sweet lord, at your service.HAMLET.Horatio, thou art e en as just a manAs e er my conversation cop d withal.HORATIO.O my dear lord.HAMLET.Nay, do not think I flatter;For what advancement may I hope from thee,That no revenue hast, but thy good spiritsTo feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter d?No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,And crook the pregnant hinges of the kneeWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,And could of men distinguish, her electionHath seal d thee for herself. For thou hast beenAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,A man that Fortune s buffets and rewardsHast ta en with equal thanks. And blessed are thoseWhose blood and judgement are so well co-mingledThat they are not a pipe for Fortune s fingerTo sound what stop she please. Give me that manThat is not passion s slave, and I will wear himIn my heart s core, ay, in my heart of heart,As I do thee. Something too much of this.There is a play tonight before the King.One scene of it comes near the circumstanceWhich I have told thee, of my father s death.I prithee, when thou see st that act a-foot,Even with the very comment of thy soulObserve mine uncle. If his occulted guiltDo not itself unkennel in one speech,It is a damned ghost that we have seen;And my imaginations are as foulAs Vulcan s stithy. Give him heedful note;For I mine eyes will rivet to his face;And after we will both our judgements joinIn censure of his seeming.HORATIO.Well, my lord.If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,And  scape detecting, I will pay the theft.HAMLET.They are coming to the play. I must be idle.Get you a place.Danish march. A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia,Rosencrantz, Guildenstern and others.KING.How fares our cousin Hamlet?HAMLET.Excellent, i  faith; of the chameleon s dish: I eat the air,promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.KING.I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.HAMLET.No, nor mine now. [_To Polonius._] My lord, you play d once i th university, you say?POLONIUS.That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.HAMLET.What did you enact?POLONIUS.I did enact ulius Caesar. I was kill d i  th  Capitol. Brutus killedme.HAMLET.It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be theplayers ready?ROSENCRANTZ.Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.QUEEN.Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.HAMLET.No, good mother, here s metal more attractive.POLONIUS.[_To the King._] O ho! do you mark that?HAMLET.Lady, shall I lie in your lap?[_Lying down at Ophelia s feet._]OPHELIA.No, my lord.HAMLET.I mean, my head upon your lap?OPHELIA.Ay, my lord.HAMLET.Do you think I meant country matters?OPHELIA.I think nothing, my lord.HAMLET.That s a fair thought to lie between maids  legs.OPHELIA.What is, my lord?HAMLET.Nothing.OPHELIA.You are merry, my lord.HAMLET.Who, I?OPHELIA.Ay, my lord.HAMLET.O God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry? For lookyou how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within s twohours.OPHELIA.Nay,  tis twice two months, my lord.HAMLET.So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I ll have a suit ofsables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Thenthere s hope a great man s memory may outlive his life half a year. Butby r lady, he must build churches then; or else shall he suffer notthinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is  For, O, for O, thehobby-horse is forgot! Trumpets sound. The dumb show enters._Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him and heher. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes herup, and declines his head upon her neck. Lays him down upon a bank offlowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow,takes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the King s ears, andexits. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionateaction. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisonerwoos the Queen with gifts. She seems loth and unwilling awhile, but inthe end accepts his love._[_Exeunt._]OPHELIA.What means this, my lord?HAMLET.Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.OPHELIA.Belike this show imports the argument of the play.Enter Prologue.HAMLET.We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they lltell all.OPHELIA.Will they tell us what this show meant?HAMLET.Ay, or any show that you ll show him. Be not you ashamed to show, he llnot shame to tell you what it means.OPHELIA.You are naught, you are naught: I ll mark the play.PROLOGUE.   _For us, and for our tragedy,   Here stooping to your clemency,   We beg your hearing patiently._HAMLET.Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?OPHELIA. Tis brief, my lord.HAMLET.As woman s love.Enter a King and a Queen.PLAYER KING.Full thirty times hath Phoebus  cart gone roundNeptune s salt wash and Tellus  orbed ground,And thirty dozen moons with borrow d sheenAbout the world have times twelve thirties been,Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our handsUnite commutual in most sacred bands.PLAYER QUEEN.So many journeys may the sun and moonMake us again count o er ere love be done.But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,So far from cheer and from your former state,That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:For women s fear and love holds quantity,In neither aught, or in extremity.Now what my love is, proof hath made you know,And as my love is siz d, my fear is so.Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.PLAYER KING.Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too:My operant powers their functions leave to do:And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,Honour d, belov d, and haply one as kindFor husband shalt thou PLAYER QUEEN.O confound the rest.Such love must needs be treason in my breast.In second husband let me be accurst!None wed the second but who kill d the first.HAMLET.[_Aside._] Wormwood, wormwood.PLAYER QUEEN.The instances that second marriage moveAre base respects of thrift, but none of love.A second time I kill my husband dead,When second husband kisses me in bed.PLAYER KING.I do believe you think what now you speak;But what we do determine, oft we break.Purpose is but the slave to memory,Of violent birth, but poor validity:Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,But fall unshaken when they mellow be.Most necessary  tis that we forgetTo pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.What to ourselves in passion we propose,The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.The violence of either grief or joyTheir own enactures with themselves destroy.Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.This world is not for aye; nor  tis not strangeThat even our loves should with our fortunes change,For  tis a question left us yet to prove,Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,The poor advanc d makes friends of enemies;And hitherto doth love on fortune tend:For who not needs shall never lack a friend,And who in want a hollow friend doth try,Directly seasons him his enemy.But orderly to end where I begun,Our wills and fates do so contrary runThat our devices still are overthrown.Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.So think thou wilt no second husband wed,But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.PLAYER QUEEN.Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,Sport and repose lock from me day and night,To desperation turn my trust and hope,An anchor s cheer in prison be my scope,Each opposite that blanks the face of joy,Meet what I would have well, and it destroy!Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,If, once a widow, ever I be wife.HAMLET.[_To Ophelia._] If she should break it now.PLAYER KING. Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguileThe tedious day with sleep.[_Sleeps._]PLAYER QUEEN.Sleep rock thy brain,And never come mischance between us twain.[_Exit._]HAMLET.Madam, how like you this play?QUEEN.The lady protests too much, methinks.HAMLET.O, but she ll keep her word.KING.Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in t?HAMLET.No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i  th  world.KING.What do you call the play?HAMLET._The Mousetrap._ Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of amurder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the Duke s name, his wife Baptista:you shall see anon;  tis a knavish piece of work: but what o  that?Your majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not. Let thegall d jade wince; our withers are unwrung.Enter Lucianus.This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.OPHELIA.You are a good chorus, my lord.HAMLET.I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppetsdallying.OPHELIA.You are keen, my lord, you are keen.HAMLET.It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.OPHELIA.Still better, and worse.HAMLET.So you mistake your husbands. Begin, murderer. Pox, leave thy damnablefaces, and begin. Come, the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.LUCIANUS.Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing,Confederate season, else no creature seeing;Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,With Hecate s ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,Thy natural magic and dire propertyOn wholesome life usurp immediately.[_Pours the poison into the sleeper s ears._]HAMLET.He poisons him i  th garden for s estate. His name s Gonzago. The storyis extant, and written in very choice Italian. You shall see anon howthe murderer gets the love of Gonzago s wife.OPHELIA.The King rises.HAMLET.What, frighted with false fire?QUEEN.How fares my lord?POLONIUS.Give o er the play.KING.Give me some light. Away.All.Lights, lights, lights.[_Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio._]HAMLET.   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,     The hart ungalled play;   For some must watch, while some must sleep,     So runs the world away.Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers, if the rest of myfortunes turn Turk with me; with two Provincial roses on my razedshoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?HORATIO.Half a share.HAMLET.A whole one, I.   For thou dost know, O Damon dear,     This realm dismantled was   Of ove himself, and now reigns here     A very, very pajock.HORATIO.You might have rhymed.HAMLET.O good Horatio, I ll take the ghost s word for a thousand pound. Didstperceive?HORATIO.Very well, my lord.HAMLET.Upon the talk of the poisoning?HORATIO.I did very well note him.HAMLET.Ah, ha! Come, some music. Come, the recorders.   For if the king like not the comedy,   Why then, belike he likes it not, perdie.Come, some music.Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.GUILDENSTERN.Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.HAMLET.Sir, a whole history.GUILDENSTERN.The King, sir HAMLET.Ay, sir, what of him?GUILDENSTERN.Is in his retirement, marvellous distempered.HAMLET.With drink, sir?GUILDENSTERN.No, my lord; rather with choler.HAMLET.Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to thedoctor, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge himinto far more choler.GUILDENSTERN.Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start not sowildly from my affair.HAMLET.I am tame, sir, pronounce.GUILDENSTERN.The Queen your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent meto you.HAMLET.You are welcome.GUILDENSTERN.Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shallplease you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother scommandment; if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of mybusiness.HAMLET.Sir, I cannot.GUILDENSTERN.What, my lord?HAMLET.Make you a wholesome answer. My wit s diseased. But, sir, such answeras I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say, my mother.Therefore no more, but to the matter. My mother, you say, ROSENCRANTZ.Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into amazement andadmiration.HAMLET.O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother! But is there no sequelat the heels of this mother s admiration?ROSENCRANTZ.She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.HAMLET.We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any furthertrade with us?ROSENCRANTZ.My lord, you once did love me.HAMLET.And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.ROSENCRANTZ.Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do surely bar thedoor upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.HAMLET.Sir, I lack advancement.ROSENCRANTZ.How can that be, when you have the voice of the King himself for yoursuccession in Denmark?HAMLET.Ay, sir, but while the grass grows the proverb is something musty.Re-enter the Players with recorders.O, the recorders. Let me see one. To withdraw with you, why do you goabout to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?GUILDENSTERN.O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.HAMLET.I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?GUILDENSTERN.My lord, I cannot.HAMLET.I pray you.GUILDENSTERN.Believe me, I cannot.HAMLET.I do beseech you.GUILDENSTERN.I know no touch of it, my lord.HAMLET. Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your finger andthumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse mosteloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.GUILDENSTERN.But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony. I have not theskill.HAMLET.Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would playupon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heartof my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of mycompass; and there is much music, excellent voice, in this littleorgan, yet cannot you make it speak.  Sblood, do you think I am easierto be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, thoughyou can fret me, you cannot play upon me.Enter Polonius.God bless you, sir.POLONIUS.My lord, the Queen would speak with you, and presently.HAMLET.Do you see yonder cloud that s almost in shape of a camel?POLONIUS.By the mass, and  tis like a camel indeed.HAMLET.Methinks it is like a weasel.POLONIUS.It is backed like a weasel.HAMLET.Or like a whale.POLONIUS.Very like a whale.HAMLET.Then will I come to my mother by and by. They fool me to the top of mybent. I will come by and by.POLONIUS.I will say so.[_Exit._]HAMLET.By and by is easily said. Leave me, friends.[_Exeunt all but Hamlet._] Tis now the very witching time of night,When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes outContagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,And do such bitter business as the dayWould quake to look on. Soft now, to my mother.O heart, lose not thy nature; let not everThe soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:Let me be cruel, not unnatural.I will speak daggers to her, but use none;My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites.How in my words somever she be shent,To give them seals never, my soul, consent.[_Exit._] SCENE III. A room in the Castle.Enter King, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.KING.I like him not, nor stands it safe with usTo let his madness range. Therefore prepare you,I your commission will forthwith dispatch,And he to England shall along with you.The terms of our estate may not endureHazard so near us as doth hourly growOut of his lunacies.GUILDENSTERN.We will ourselves provide.Most holy and religious fear it isTo keep those many many bodies safeThat live and feed upon your Majesty.ROSENCRANTZ.The single and peculiar life is boundWith all the strength and armour of the mind,To keep itself from  noyance; but much moreThat spirit upon whose weal depend and restThe lives of many. The cease of majestyDies not alone; but like a gulf doth drawWhat s near it with it. It is a massy wheelFix d on the summit of the highest mount,To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser thingsAre mortis d and adjoin d; which when it falls,Each small annexment, petty consequence,Attends the boist rous ruin. Never aloneDid the King sigh, but with a general groan.KING.Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;For we will fetters put upon this fear,Which now goes too free-footed.ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.We will haste us.[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]Enter Polonius.POLONIUS.My lord, he s going to his mother s closet.Behind the arras I ll convey myselfTo hear the process. I ll warrant she ll tax him home,And as you said, and wisely was it said, Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,Since nature makes them partial, should o erhearThe speech of vantage. Fare you well, my liege,I ll call upon you ere you go to bed,And tell you what I know.KING.Thanks, dear my lord.[_Exit Polonius._]O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;It hath the primal eldest curse upon t, A brother s murder! Pray can I not,Though inclination be as sharp as will:My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent,And, like a man to double business bound,I stand in pause where I shall first begin,And both neglect. What if this cursed handWere thicker than itself with brother s blood,Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavensTo wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercyBut to confront the visage of offence?And what s in prayer but this twofold force,To be forestalled ere we come to fall,Or pardon d being down? Then I ll look up.My fault is past. But O, what form of prayerCan serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!That cannot be; since I am still possess dOf those effects for which I did the murder, My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.May one be pardon d and retain th offence?In the corrupted currents of this worldOffence s gilded hand may shove by justice,And oft  tis seen the wicked prize itselfBuys out the law. But  tis not so above;There is no shuffling, there the action liesIn his true nature, and we ourselves compell dEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults,To give in evidence. What then? What rests?Try what repentance can. What can it not?Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?O wretched state! O bosom black as death!O limed soul, that struggling to be free,Art more engag d! Help, angels! Make assay:Bow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe.All may be well.[_Retires and kneels._]Enter Hamlet.HAMLET.Now might I do it pat, now he is praying.And now I ll do t. And so he goes to heaven;And so am I reveng d. That would be scann d:A villain kills my father, and for thatI, his sole son, do this same villain sendTo heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.He took my father grossly, full of bread,With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?But in our circumstance and course of thought, Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng d,To take him in the purging of his soul,When he is fit and season d for his passage? No.Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage,Or in th incestuous pleasure of his bed,At gaming, swearing; or about some actThat has no relish of salvation in t,Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,And that his soul may be as damn d and blackAs hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.[_Exit._]The King rises and advances.KING.My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.Words without thoughts never to heaven go.[_Exit._] SCENE IV. Another room in the Castle.Enter Queen and Polonius.POLONIUS.He will come straight. Look you lay home to him,Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,And that your Grace hath screen d and stood betweenMuch heat and him. I ll silence me e en here.Pray you be round with him.HAMLET.[_Within._] Mother, mother, mother.QUEEN.I ll warrant you, Fear me not.Withdraw, I hear him coming.[_Polonius goes behind the arras._]Enter Hamlet.HAMLET.Now, mother, what s the matter?QUEEN.Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.HAMLET.Mother, you have my father much offended.QUEEN.Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.HAMLET.Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.QUEEN.Why, how now, Hamlet?HAMLET.What s the matter now?QUEEN.Have you forgot me?HAMLET.No, by the rood, not so.You are the Queen, your husband s brother s wife,And, would it were not so. You are my mother.QUEEN.Nay, then I ll set those to you that can speak.HAMLET.Come, come, and sit you down, you shall not budge.You go not till I set you up a glassWhere you may see the inmost part of you.QUEEN.What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me?Help, help, ho!POLONIUS.[_Behind._] What, ho! help, help, help!HAMLET.How now? A rat? [_Draws._]Dead for a ducat, dead![_Makes a pass through the arras._]POLONIUS.[_Behind._] O, I am slain![_Falls and dies._]QUEEN.O me, what hast thou done?HAMLET.Nay, I know not. Is it the King?[_Draws forth Polonius._]QUEEN.O what a rash and bloody deed is this!HAMLET.A bloody deed. Almost as bad, good mother,As kill a king and marry with his brother.QUEEN.As kill a king?HAMLET.Ay, lady,  twas my word. [_To Polonius._] Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!I took thee for thy better. Take thy fortune,Thou find st to be too busy is some danger. Leave wringing of your hands. Peace, sit you down,And let me wring your heart, for so I shall,If it be made of penetrable stuff;If damned custom have not braz d it so,That it is proof and bulwark against sense.QUEEN.What have I done, that thou dar st wag thy tongueIn noise so rude against me?HAMLET.Such an actThat blurs the grace and blush of modesty,Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the roseFrom the fair forehead of an innocent love,And sets a blister there. Makes marriage vowsAs false as dicers  oaths. O such a deedAs from the body of contraction plucksThe very soul, and sweet religion makesA rhapsody of words. Heaven s face doth glow,Yea this solidity and compound mass,With tristful visage, as against the doom,Is thought-sick at the act.QUEEN.Ay me, what act,That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?HAMLET.Look here upon this picture, and on this,The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.See what a grace was seated on this brow,Hyperion s curls, the front of ove himself,An eye like Mars, to threaten and command,A station like the herald MercuryNew lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:A combination and a form indeed,Where every god did seem to set his seal,To give the world assurance of a man.This was your husband. Look you now what follows.Here is your husband, like a mildew d earBlasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?You cannot call it love; for at your ageThe hey-day in the blood is tame, it s humble,And waits upon the judgement: and what judgementWould step from this to this? Sense sure you have,Else could you not have motion; but sure that senseIs apoplex d, for madness would not errNor sense to ecstacy was ne er so thrall dBut it reserv d some quantity of choiceTo serve in such a difference. What devil was tThat thus hath cozen d you at hoodman-blind?Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,Or but a sickly part of one true senseCould not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush?Rebellious hell,If thou canst mutine in a matron s bones,To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,And melt in her own fire. Proclaim no shameWhen the compulsive ardour gives the charge,Since frost itself as actively doth burn,And reason panders will.QUEEN.O Hamlet, speak no more.Thou turn st mine eyes into my very soul,And there I see such black and grained spotsAs will not leave their tinct.HAMLET.Nay, but to liveIn the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,Stew d in corruption, honeying and making loveOver the nasty sty.QUEEN.O speak to me no more;These words like daggers enter in mine ears;No more, sweet Hamlet.HAMLET.A murderer and a villain;A slave that is not twentieth part the titheOf your precedent lord. A vice of kings,A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,That from a shelf the precious diadem stoleAnd put it in his pocket!QUEEN.No more.HAMLET.A king of shreds and patches! Enter Ghost.Save me and hover o er me with your wings,You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?QUEEN.Alas, he s mad.HAMLET.Do you not come your tardy son to chide,That, laps d in time and passion, lets go byThe important acting of your dread command?O say!GHOST.Do not forget. This visitationIs but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.But look, amazement on thy mother sits.O step between her and her fighting soul.Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works.Speak to her, Hamlet.HAMLET.How is it with you, lady?QUEEN.Alas, how is t with you,That you do bend your eye on vacancy,And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep,And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,Upon the heat and flame of thy distemperSprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?HAMLET.On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares,His form and cause conjoin d, preaching to stones,Would make them capable. Do not look upon me,Lest with this piteous action you convertMy stern effects. Then what I have to doWill want true colour; tears perchance for blood.QUEEN.To whom do you speak this?HAMLET.Do you see nothing there?QUEEN.Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.HAMLET.Nor did you nothing hear?QUEEN.No, nothing but ourselves.HAMLET.Why, look you there! look how it steals away!My father, in his habit as he liv d!Look where he goes even now out at the portal.[_Exit Ghost._]QUEEN.This is the very coinage of your brain.This bodiless creation ecstasyIs very cunning in.HAMLET.Ecstasy!My pulse as yours doth temperately keep time,And makes as healthful music. It is not madnessThat I have utter d. Bring me to the test,And I the matter will re-word; which madnessWould gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,Lay not that flattering unction to your soulThat not your trespass, but my madness speaks.It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven,Repent what s past, avoid what is to come;And do not spread the compost on the weeds,To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;For in the fatness of these pursy timesVirtue itself of vice must pardon beg,Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.QUEEN.O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.HAMLET.O throw away the worser part of it,And live the purer with the other half.Good night. But go not to mine uncle s bed.Assume a virtue, if you have it not.That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,That to the use of actions fair and goodHe likewise gives a frock or liveryThat aptly is put on. Refrain tonight,And that shall lend a kind of easinessTo the next abstinence. The next more easy;For use almost can change the stamp of nature,And either curb the devil, or throw him outWith wondrous potency. Once more, good night,And when you are desirous to be bles d,I ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord[_Pointing to Polonius._]I do repent; but heaven hath pleas d it so,To punish me with this, and this with me,That I must be their scourge and minister.I will bestow him, and will answer wellThe death I gave him. So again, good night.I must be cruel, only to be kind:Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.One word more, good lady.QUEEN.What shall I do?HAMLET.Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:Let the bloat King tempt you again to bed,Pinch wanton on your cheek, call you his mouse,And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,Or paddling in your neck with his damn d fingers,Make you to ravel all this matter out,That I essentially am not in madness,But mad in craft.  Twere good you let him know,For who that s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,Such dear concernings hide? Who would do so?No, in despite of sense and secrecy,Unpeg the basket on the house s top,Let the birds fly, and like the famous ape,To try conclusions, in the basket creepAnd break your own neck down.QUEEN.Be thou assur d, if words be made of breath,And breath of life, I have no life to breatheWhat thou hast said to me.HAMLET.I must to England, you know that?QUEEN.Alack,I had forgot.  Tis so concluded on.HAMLET.There s letters seal d: and my two schoolfellows,Whom I will trust as I will adders fang d, They bear the mandate, they must sweep my wayAnd marshal me to knavery. Let it work;For  tis the sport to have the enginerHoist with his own petard, and  t shall go hardBut I will delve one yard below their minesAnd blow them at the moon. O,  tis most sweet,When in one line two crafts directly meet.This man shall set me packing.I ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.Mother, good night. Indeed, this counsellorIs now most still, most secret, and most grave,Who was in life a foolish prating knave.Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.Good night, mother.[_Exit Hamlet dragging out Polonius._]ACT IVSCENE I. A room in the Castle.Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.KING.There s matter in these sighs. These profound heavesYou must translate;  tis fit we understand them.Where is your son?QUEEN.Bestow this place on us a little while.[_To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who go out._]Ah, my good lord, what have I seen tonight!KING.What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?QUEEN.Mad as the sea and wind, when both contendWhich is the mightier. In his lawless fitBehind the arras hearing something stir,Whips out his rapier, cries  A rat, a rat! And in this brainish apprehension killsThe unseen good old man.KING.O heavy deed!It had been so with us, had we been there.His liberty is full of threats to all;To you yourself, to us, to everyone.Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer d?It will be laid to us, whose providenceShould have kept short, restrain d, and out of hauntThis mad young man. But so much was our loveWe would not understand what was most fit,But like the owner of a foul disease,To keep it from divulging, let it feedEven on the pith of life. Where is he gone?QUEEN.To draw apart the body he hath kill d,O er whom his very madness, like some oreAmong a mineral of metals base,Shows itself pure. He weeps for what is done.KING.O Gertrude, come away!The sun no sooner shall the mountains touchBut we will ship him hence, and this vile deedWe must with all our majesty and skillBoth countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.Friends both, go join you with some further aid:Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,And from his mother s closet hath he dragg d him.Go seek him out, speak fair, and bring the bodyInto the chapel. I pray you haste in this.[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]Come, Gertrude, we ll call up our wisest friends,And let them know both what we mean to doAnd what s untimely done, so haply slander,Whose whisper o er the world s diameter,As level as the cannon to his blank,Transports his poison d shot, may miss our name,And hit the woundless air. O, come away!My soul is full of discord and dismay.[_Exeunt._] SCENE II. Another room in the Castle.Enter Hamlet.HAMLET.Safely stowed.ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.[_Within._] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!HAMLET.What noise? Who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.ROSENCRANTZ.What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?HAMLET.Compounded it with dust, whereto  tis kin.ROSENCRANTZ.Tell us where  tis, that we may take it thence,And bear it to the chapel.HAMLET.Do not believe it.ROSENCRANTZ.Believe what?HAMLET.That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be demandedof a sponge what replication should be made by the son of a king?ROSENCRANTZ.Take you me for a sponge, my lord?HAMLET.Ay, sir; that soaks up the King s countenance, his rewards, hisauthorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end: hekeeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to belast swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is butsqueezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.ROSENCRANTZ.I understand you not, my lord.HAMLET.I am glad of it. A knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.ROSENCRANTZ.My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to the King.HAMLET.The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The Kingis a thing GUILDENSTERN.A thing, my lord!HAMLET.Of nothing. Bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.[_Exeunt._] SCENE III. Another room in the Castle.Enter King, attended.KING.I have sent to seek him and to find the body.How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!Yet must not we put the strong law on him:He s lov d of the distracted multitude,Who like not in their judgement, but their eyes;And where  tis so, th offender s scourge is weigh d,But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,This sudden sending him away must seemDeliberate pause. Diseases desperate grownBy desperate appliance are reliev d,Or not at all.Enter Rosencrantz.How now? What hath befall n?ROSENCRANTZ.Where the dead body is bestow d, my lord,We cannot get from him.KING.But where is he?ROSENCRANTZ.Without, my lord, guarded, to know your pleasure.KING.Bring him before us.ROSENCRANTZ.Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.KING.Now, Hamlet, where s Polonius?HAMLET.At supper.KING.At supper? Where?HAMLET.Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation ofpolitic worms are e en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet.We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots.Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service, two dishes,but to one table. That s the end.KING.Alas, alas!HAMLET.A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of thefish that hath fed of that worm.KING.What dost thou mean by this?HAMLET.Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the gutsof a beggar.KING.Where is Polonius?HAMLET.In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not there,seek him i  th other place yourself. But indeed, if you find him notwithin this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into thelobby.KING.[_To some Attendants._] Go seek him there.HAMLET.He will stay till you come.[_Exeunt Attendants._]KING.Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety, Which we do tender, as we dearly grieveFor that which thou hast done, must send thee henceWith fiery quickness. Therefore prepare thyself;The bark is ready, and the wind at help,Th associates tend, and everything is bentFor England.HAMLET.For England?KING.Ay, Hamlet.HAMLET.Good.KING.So is it, if thou knew st our purposes.HAMLET.I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dearmother.KING.Thy loving father, Hamlet.HAMLET.My mother. Father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is oneflesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England.[_Exit._]KING.Follow him at foot. Tempt him with speed aboard;Delay it not; I ll have him hence tonight.Away, for everything is seal d and doneThat else leans on th affair. Pray you make haste.[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]And England, if my love thou hold st at aught, As my great power thereof may give thee sense,Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and redAfter the Danish sword, and thy free awePays homage to us, thou mayst not coldly setOur sovereign process, which imports at full,By letters conjuring to that effect,The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;For like the hectic in my blood he rages,And thou must cure me. Till I know  tis done,Howe er my haps, my joys were ne er begun.[_Exit._] SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.Enter Fortinbras and Forces marching.FORTINBRAS.Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king.Tell him that by his license, FortinbrasCraves the conveyance of a promis d marchOver his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.If that his Majesty would aught with us,We shall express our duty in his eye;And let him know so.CAPTAIN.I will do t, my lord.FORTINBRAS.Go softly on.[_Exeunt all but the Captain._]Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern c.HAMLET.Good sir, whose powers are these?CAPTAIN.They are of Norway, sir.HAMLET.How purpos d, sir, I pray you?CAPTAIN.Against some part of Poland.HAMLET.Who commands them, sir?CAPTAIN.The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.HAMLET.Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,Or for some frontier?CAPTAIN.Truly to speak, and with no addition,We go to gain a little patch of groundThat hath in it no profit but the name.To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;Nor will it yield to Norway or the PoleA ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.HAMLET.Why, then the Polack never will defend it.CAPTAIN.Yes, it is already garrison d.HAMLET.Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducatsWill not debate the question of this straw!This is th imposthume of much wealth and peace,That inward breaks, and shows no cause withoutWhy the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.CAPTAIN.God b  wi  you, sir.[_Exit._]ROSENCRANTZ.Will t please you go, my lord?HAMLET.I ll be with you straight. Go a little before.[_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]How all occasions do inform against me,And spur my dull revenge. What is a manIf his chief good and market of his timeBe but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.Sure he that made us with such large discourse,Looking before and after, gave us notThat capability and godlike reasonTo fust in us unus d. Now whether it beBestial oblivion, or some craven scrupleOf thinking too precisely on th event, A thought which, quarter d, hath but one part wisdomAnd ever three parts coward, I do not knowWhy yet I live to say this thing s to do,Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and meansTo do t. Examples gross as earth exhort me,Witness this army of such mass and charge,Led by a delicate and tender prince,Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff d,Makes mouths at the invisible event,Exposing what is mortal and unsureTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,Even for an eggshell. Rightly to be greatIs not to stir without great argument,But greatly to find quarrel in a strawWhen honour s at the stake. How stand I then,That have a father kill d, a mother stain d,Excitements of my reason and my blood,And let all sleep, while to my shame I seeThe imminent death of twenty thousand menThat, for a fantasy and trick of fame,Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plotWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,Which is not tomb enough and continentTo hide the slain? O, from this time forth,My thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.[_Exit._] SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the Castle.Enter Queen, Horatio and a Gentleman.QUEEN.I will not speak with her.GENTLEMAN.She is importunate, indeed distract.Her mood will needs be pitied.QUEEN.What would she have?GENTLEMAN.She speaks much of her father; says she hearsThere s tricks i  th  world, and hems, and beats her heart,Spurns enviously at straws, speaks things in doubt,That carry but half sense. Her speech is nothing,Yet the unshaped use of it doth moveThe hearers to collection; they aim at it,And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts,Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,Indeed would make one think there might be thought,Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily. Twere good she were spoken with, for she may strewDangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.QUEEN.Let her come in.[_Exit Gentleman._]To my sick soul, as sin s true nature is,Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss.So full of artless jealousy is guilt,It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.Enter Ophelia.OPHELIA.Where is the beauteous Majesty of Denmark?QUEEN.How now, Ophelia?OPHELIA.[_Sings._]   How should I your true love know     From another one?   By his cockle hat and staff     And his sandal shoon.QUEEN.Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?OPHELIA.Say you? Nay, pray you mark.[_Sings._]   He is dead and gone, lady,     He is dead and gone,   At his head a grass green turf,     At his heels a stone.QUEEN.Nay, but Ophelia OPHELIA.Pray you mark.[_Sings._]   White his shroud as the mountain snow.Enter King.QUEEN.Alas, look here, my lord!OPHELIA.[_Sings._]     Larded all with sweet flowers;   Which bewept to the grave did not go     With true-love showers.KING.How do you, pretty lady?OPHELIA.Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker s daughter. Lord, weknow what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!KING.Conceit upon her father.OPHELIA.Pray you, let s have no words of this; but when they ask you what itmeans, say you this:[_Sings._]   Tomorrow is Saint Valentine s day,     All in the morning betime,   And I a maid at your window,     To be your Valentine.   Then up he rose and donn d his clothes,     And dupp d the chamber door,   Let in the maid, that out a maid     Never departed more.KING.Pretty Ophelia!OPHELIA.Indeed la, without an oath, I ll make an end on t.[_Sings._]   By Gis and by Saint Charity,     Alack, and fie for shame!   Young men will do t if they come to t;     By Cock, they are to blame.   Quoth she, before you tumbled me,     You promis d me to wed.   So would I ha  done, by yonder sun,     An thou hadst not come to my bed.KING.How long hath she been thus?OPHELIA.I hope all will be well. We must be patient. But I cannot choose butweep, to think they would lay him i  th  cold ground. My brother shallknow of it. And so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach!Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.[_Exit._]KING.Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.[_Exit Horatio._]O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springsAll from her father s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,When sorrows come, they come not single spies,But in battalions. First, her father slain;Next, your son gone; and he most violent authorOf his own just remove; the people muddied,Thick, and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispersFor good Polonius  death; and we have done but greenlyIn hugger-mugger to inter him. Poor OpheliaDivided from herself and her fair judgement,Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts.Last, and as much containing as all these,Her brother is in secret come from France,Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,And wants not buzzers to infect his earWith pestilent speeches of his father s death,Wherein necessity, of matter beggar d,Will nothing stick our person to arraignIn ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,Like to a murdering piece, in many placesGives me superfluous death.[_A noise within._]QUEEN.Alack, what noise is this?KING.Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.Enter a Gentleman.What is the matter?GENTLEMAN.Save yourself, my lord.The ocean, overpeering of his list,Eats not the flats with more impetuous hasteThan young Laertes, in a riotous head,O erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord,And, as the world were now but to begin,Antiquity forgot, custom not known,The ratifiers and props of every word,They cry  Choose we! Laertes shall be king! Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds, Laertes shall be king, Laertes king. QUEEN.How cheerfully on the false trail they cry.O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs.[_A noise within._]KING.The doors are broke.Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.LAERTES.Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.Danes.No, let s come in.LAERTES.I pray you, give me leave.DANES.We will, we will.[_They retire without the door._]LAERTES.I thank you. Keep the door. O thou vile king,Give me my father.QUEEN.Calmly, good Laertes.LAERTES.That drop of blood that s calm proclaims me bastard;Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlotEven here between the chaste unsmirched browOf my true mother.KING.What is the cause, Laertes,That thy rebellion looks so giant-like? Let him go, Gertrude. Do not fear our person.There s such divinity doth hedge a king,That treason can but peep to what it would,Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,Why thou art thus incens d. Let him go, Gertrude: Speak, man.LAERTES.Where is my father?KING.Dead.QUEEN.But not by him.KING.Let him demand his fill.LAERTES.How came he dead? I ll not be juggled with.To hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!I dare damnation. To this point I stand,That both the worlds, I give to negligence,Let come what comes; only I ll be reveng dMost throughly for my father.KING.Who shall stay you?LAERTES.My will, not all the world.And for my means, I ll husband them so well,They shall go far with little.KING.Good Laertes,If you desire to know the certaintyOf your dear father s death, is t writ in your revengeThat, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,Winner and loser?LAERTES.None but his enemies.KING.Will you know them then?LAERTES.To his good friends thus wide I ll ope my arms;And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,Repast them with my blood.KING.Why, now you speakLike a good child and a true gentleman.That I am guiltless of your father s death,And am most sensibly in grief for it,It shall as level to your judgement  pearAs day does to your eye.DANES.[_Within._] Let her come in.LAERTES.How now! What noise is that?Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers.O heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt,Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye.By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!O heavens, is t possible a young maid s witsShould be as mortal as an old man s life?Nature is fine in love, and where  tis fine,It sends some precious instance of itselfAfter the thing it loves.OPHELIA.[_Sings._]   They bore him barefac d on the bier,   Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny   And on his grave rain d many a tear.    Fare you well, my dove!LAERTES.Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,It could not move thus.OPHELIA.You must sing  Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.  O, how thewheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master sdaughter.LAERTES.This nothing s more than matter.OPHELIA.There s rosemary, that s for remembrance; pray love, remember. Andthere is pansies, that s for thoughts.LAERTES.A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.OPHELIA.There s fennel for you, and columbines. There s rue for you; and here ssome for me. We may call it herb of grace o  Sundays. O you must wearyour rue with a difference. There s a daisy. I would give you someviolets, but they wither d all when my father died. They say he made agood end.[_Sings._]   For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.LAERTES.Thought and affliction, passion, hell itselfShe turns to favour and to prettiness.OPHELIA.[_Sings._]   And will he not come again?   And will he not come again?     No, no, he is dead,     Go to thy death-bed,   He never will come again.   His beard was as white as snow,   All flaxen was his poll.     He is gone, he is gone,     And we cast away moan.   God ha  mercy on his soul.And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b  wi  ye.[_Exit._]LAERTES.Do you see this, O God?KING.Laertes, I must commune with your grief,Or you deny me right. Go but apart,Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,And they shall hear and judge  twixt you and me.If by direct or by collateral handThey find us touch d, we will our kingdom give,Our crown, our life, and all that we call oursTo you in satisfaction; but if not,Be you content to lend your patience to us,And we shall jointly labour with your soulTo give it due content.LAERTES.Let this be so;His means of death, his obscure burial, No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o er his bones,No noble rite, nor formal ostentation, Cry to be heard, as  twere from heaven to earth,That I must call t in question.KING.So you shall.And where th offence is let the great axe fall.I pray you go with me.[_Exeunt._] SCENE VI. Another room in the Castle.Enter Horatio and a Servant.HORATIO.What are they that would speak with me?SERVANT.Sailors, sir. They say they have letters for you.HORATIO.Let them come in.[_Exit Servant._]I do not know from what part of the worldI should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.Enter Sailors.FIRST SAILOR.God bless you, sir.HORATIO.Let him bless thee too.FIRST SAILOR.He shall, sir, and t please him. There s a letter for you, sir. Itcomes from th ambassador that was bound for England; if your name beHoratio, as I am let to know it is.HORATIO.[_Reads._]  Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give thesefellows some means to the King. They have letters for him. Ere we weretwo days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave uschase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelledvalour, and in the grapple I boarded them. On the instant they gotclear of our ship, so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealtwith me like thieves of mercy. But they knew what they did; I am to doa good turn for them. Let the King have the letters I have sent, andrepair thou to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I havewords to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much toolight for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring theewhere I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England:of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.     He that thou knowest thine,     HAMLET. Come, I will give you way for these your letters,And do t the speedier, that you may direct meTo him from whom you brought them.[_Exeunt._] SCENE VII. Another room in the Castle.Enter King and Laertes.KING.Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,And you must put me in your heart for friend,Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,That he which hath your noble father slainPursu d my life.LAERTES.It well appears. But tell meWhy you proceeded not against these feats,So crimeful and so capital in nature,As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,You mainly were stirr d up.KING.O, for two special reasons,Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew d,But yet to me they are strong. The Queen his motherLives almost by his looks; and for myself, My virtue or my plague, be it either which, She s so conjunctive to my life and soul,That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,I could not but by her. The other motive,Why to a public count I might not go,Is the great love the general gender bear him,Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,Would like the spring that turneth wood to stone,Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,Too slightly timber d for so loud a wind,Would have reverted to my bow again,And not where I had aim d them.LAERTES.And so have I a noble father lost,A sister driven into desperate terms,Whose worth, if praises may go back again,Stood challenger on mount of all the ageFor her perfections. But my revenge will come.KING.Break not your sleeps for that. You must not thinkThat we are made of stuff so flat and dullThat we can let our beard be shook with danger,And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.I lov d your father, and we love ourself,And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine Enter a Messenger.How now? What news?MESSENGER.Letters, my lord, from Hamlet.This to your Majesty; this to the Queen.KING.From Hamlet! Who brought them?MESSENGER.Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.They were given me by Claudio. He receiv d themOf him that brought them.KING.Laertes, you shall hear them.Leave us.[_Exit Messenger._][_Reads._]  High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on yourkingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When Ishall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of mysudden and more strange return.     HAMLET. What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?LAERTES.Know you the hand?KING. Tis Hamlet s character.  Naked! And in a postscript here he says  alone. Can you advise me?LAERTES.I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come,It warms the very sickness in my heartThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth, Thus diest thou. KING.If it be so, Laertes, As how should it be so? How otherwise? Will you be rul d by me?LAERTES.Ay, my lord;So you will not o errule me to a peace.KING.To thine own peace. If he be now return d,As checking at his voyage, and that he meansNo more to undertake it, I will work himTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,Under the which he shall not choose but fall;And for his death no wind shall breathe,But even his mother shall uncharge the practiceAnd call it accident.LAERTES.My lord, I will be rul d;The rather if you could devise it soThat I might be the organ.KING.It falls right.You have been talk d of since your travel much,And that in Hamlet s hearing, for a qualityWherein they say you shine. Your sum of partsDid not together pluck such envy from himAs did that one, and that, in my regard,Of the unworthiest siege.LAERTES.What part is that, my lord?KING.A very riband in the cap of youth,Yet needful too, for youth no less becomesThe light and careless livery that it wearsThan settled age his sables and his weeds,Importing health and graveness. Two months sinceHere was a gentleman of Normandy, I ve seen myself, and serv d against, the French,And they can well on horseback, but this gallantHad witchcraft in t. He grew unto his seat,And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,As had he been incorps d and demi-natur dWith the brave beast. So far he topp d my thoughtThat I in forgery of shapes and tricks,Come short of what he did.LAERTES.A Norman was t?KING.A Norman.LAERTES.Upon my life, Lamord.KING.The very same.LAERTES.I know him well. He is the brooch indeedAnd gem of all the nation.KING.He made confession of you,And gave you such a masterly reportFor art and exercise in your defence,And for your rapier most especially,That he cried out  twould be a sight indeedIf one could match you. The scrimers of their nationHe swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,If you oppos d them. Sir, this report of hisDid Hamlet so envenom with his envyThat he could nothing do but wish and begYour sudden coming o er to play with him.Now, out of this, LAERTES.What out of this, my lord?KING.Laertes, was your father dear to you?Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,A face without a heart?LAERTES.Why ask you this?KING.Not that I think you did not love your father,But that I know love is begun by time,And that I see, in passages of proof,Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.There lives within the very flame of loveA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;And nothing is at a like goodness still,For goodness, growing to a pleurisy,Dies in his own too much. That we would do,We should do when we would; for this  would  changes,And hath abatements and delays as manyAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;And then this  should  is like a spendthrift sighThat hurts by easing. But to the quick o  th ulcer:Hamlet comes back: what would you undertakeTo show yourself your father s son in deed,More than in words?LAERTES.To cut his throat i  th  church.KING.No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;Revenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.Hamlet return d shall know you are come home:We ll put on those shall praise your excellence,And set a double varnish on the fameThe Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine togetherAnd wager on your heads. He, being remiss,Most generous, and free from all contriving,Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,Or with a little shuffling, you may chooseA sword unbated, and in a pass of practice,Requite him for your father.LAERTES.I will do t.And for that purpose I ll anoint my sword.I bought an unction of a mountebankSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,Collected from all simples that have virtueUnder the moon, can save the thing from deathThis is but scratch d withal. I ll touch my pointWith this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,It may be death.KING.Let s further think of this,Weigh what convenience both of time and meansMay fit us to our shape. If this should fail,And that our drift look through our bad performance. Twere better not assay d. Therefore this projectShould have a back or second, that might holdIf this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.We ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings, I ha t! When in your motion you are hot and dry,As make your bouts more violent to that end,And that he calls for drink, I ll have prepar d himA chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,If he by chance escape your venom d stuck,Our purpose may hold there.Enter Queen.How now, sweet Queen?QUEEN.One woe doth tread upon another s heel,So fast they follow. Your sister s drown d, Laertes.LAERTES.Drown d! O, where?QUEEN.There is a willow grows aslant a brook,That shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.There with fantastic garlands did she makeOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,But our cold maids do dead men s fingers call them.There on the pendant boughs her coronet weedsClamb ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,When down her weedy trophies and herselfFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,And mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,As one incapable of her own distress,Or like a creature native and induedUnto that element. But long it could not beTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,Pull d the poor wretch from her melodious layTo muddy death.LAERTES.Alas, then she is drown d?QUEEN.Drown d, drown d.LAERTES.Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,And therefore I forbid my tears. But yetIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,Let shame say what it will. When these are gone,The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord,I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,But that this folly douts it.[_Exit._]KING.Let s follow, Gertrude;How much I had to do to calm his rage!Now fear I this will give it start again;Therefore let s follow.[_Exeunt._]ACT VSCENE I. A churchyard.Enter two Clowns with spades, c.FIRST CLOWN.Is she to be buried in Christian burial, when she wilfully seeks herown salvation?SECOND CLOWN.I tell thee she is, and therefore make her grave straight. The crownerhath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.FIRST CLOWN.How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?SECOND CLOWN.Why,  tis found so.FIRST CLOWN.It must be _se offendendo_, it cannot be else. For here lies the point:if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath threebranches. It is to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drownedherself wittingly.SECOND CLOWN.Nay, but hear you, goodman delver, FIRST CLOWN.Give me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. Ifthe man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, hegoes, mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, hedrowns not himself. Argal, he that is not guilty of his own deathshortens not his own life.SECOND CLOWN.But is this law?FIRST CLOWN.Ay, marry, is t, crowner s quest law.SECOND CLOWN.Will you ha  the truth on t? If this had not been a gentlewoman, sheshould have been buried out o  Christian burial.FIRST CLOWN.Why, there thou say st. And the more pity that great folk should havecountenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than theireven Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen butgardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam s profession.SECOND CLOWN.Was he a gentleman?FIRST CLOWN.He was the first that ever bore arms.SECOND CLOWN.Why, he had none.FIRST CLOWN.What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? TheScripture says Adam digg d. Could he dig without arms? I ll put anotherquestion to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confessthyself SECOND CLOWN.Go to.FIRST CLOWN.What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright,or the carpenter?SECOND CLOWN.The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.FIRST CLOWN.I like thy wit well in good faith, the gallows does well. But how doesit well? It does well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to saythe gallows is built stronger than the church; argal, the gallows maydo well to thee. To t again, come.SECOND CLOWN.Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?FIRST CLOWN.Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.SECOND CLOWN.Marry, now I can tell.FIRST CLOWN.To t.SECOND CLOWN.Mass, I cannot tell.Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.FIRST CLOWN.Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend hispace with beating; and when you are asked this question next, say  agrave-maker . The houses he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee toYaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor.[_Exit Second Clown._][_Digs and sings._]   In youth when I did love, did love,     Methought it was very sweet;   To contract, O, the time for, a, my behove,     O methought there was nothing meet.HAMLET.Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings atgrave-making?HORATIO.Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.HAMLET. Tis e en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.FIRST CLOWN.[_Sings._]   But age with his stealing steps     Hath claw d me in his clutch,   And hath shipp d me into the land,     As if I had never been such.[_Throws up a skull._]HAMLET.That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowlsit to th  ground, as if  twere Cain s jawbone, that did the firstmurder! This might be the pate of a politician which this ass nowo er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not?HORATIO.It might, my lord.HAMLET.Or of a courtier, which could say  Good morrow, sweet lord! How dostthou, good lord?  This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised mylord such-a-one s horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?HORATIO.Ay, my lord.HAMLET.Why, e en so: and now my Lady Worm s; chapless, and knocked about themazard with a sexton s spade. Here s fine revolution, an we had thetrick to see t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to playat loggets with  em? Mine ache to think on t.FIRST CLOWN.[_Sings._]   A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,     For and a shrouding-sheet;   O, a pit of clay for to be made     For such a guest is meet.[_Throws up another skull._]HAMLET.There s another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where behis quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks?Why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconcewith a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery?Hum. This fellow might be in s time a great buyer of land, with hisstatutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, hisrecoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of hisrecoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchersvouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than thelength and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of hislands will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himselfhave no more, ha?HORATIO.Not a jot more, my lord.HAMLET.Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?HORATIO.Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.HAMLET.They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I willspeak to this fellow. Whose grave s this, sir?FIRST CLOWN.Mine, sir.[_Sings._]   O, a pit of clay for to be made     For such a guest is meet.HAMLET.I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in t.FIRST CLOWN.You lie out on t, sir, and therefore  tis not yours.For my part, I do not lie in t, yet it is mine.HAMLET.Thou dost lie in t, to be in t and say it is thine.  Tis for the dead,not for the quick; therefore thou liest.FIRST CLOWN. Tis a quick lie, sir;  t will away again from me to you.HAMLET.What man dost thou dig it for?FIRST CLOWN.For no man, sir.HAMLET.What woman then?FIRST CLOWN.For none neither.HAMLET.Who is to be buried in t?FIRST CLOWN.One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she s dead.HAMLET.How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or equivocationwill undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken noteof it, the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes sonear the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe. How long hast thoubeen a grave-maker?FIRST CLOWN.Of all the days i  th  year, I came to t that day that our last KingHamlet o ercame Fortinbras.HAMLET.How long is that since?FIRST CLOWN.Cannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very daythat young Hamlet was born, he that is mad, and sent into England.HAMLET.Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?FIRST CLOWN.Why, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there; or if he donot, it s no great matter there.HAMLET.Why?FIRST CLOWN. Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.HAMLET.How came he mad?FIRST CLOWN.Very strangely, they say.HAMLET.How strangely?FIRST CLOWN.Faith, e en with losing his wits.HAMLET.Upon what ground?FIRST CLOWN.Why, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirtyyears.HAMLET.How long will a man lie i  th earth ere he rot?FIRST CLOWN.Faith, if he be not rotten before he die, as we have many pocky corsesnowadays that will scarce hold the laying in, he will last you someeight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year.HAMLET.Why he more than another?FIRST CLOWN.Why, sir, his hide is so tann d with his trade that he will keep outwater a great while. And your water is a sore decayer of your whoresondead body. Here s a skull now; this skull hath lain in the earththree-and-twenty years.HAMLET.Whose was it?FIRST CLOWN.A whoreson, mad fellow s it was. Whose do you think it was?HAMLET.Nay, I know not.FIRST CLOWN.A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! A pour d a flagon of Rhenish on myhead once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick s skull, the King s jester.HAMLET.This?FIRST CLOWN.E en that.HAMLET.Let me see. [_Takes the skull._] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him,Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hathborne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in myimagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that Ihave kiss d I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols?your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the tableon a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chop-fallen?Now get you to my lady s chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inchthick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that. Prithee,Horatio, tell me one thing.HORATIO.What s that, my lord?HAMLET.Dost thou think Alexander looked o  this fashion i  th earth?HORATIO.E en so.HAMLET.And smelt so? Pah![_Throws down the skull._]HORATIO.E en so, my lord.HAMLET.To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination tracethe noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?HORATIO. Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.HAMLET.No, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty enough,and likelihood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died, Alexander wasburied, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth wemake loam; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they notstop a beer-barrel?Imperious Caesar, dead and turn d to clay,Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.O, that that earth which kept the world in aweShould patch a wall t expel the winter s flaw.But soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King.Enter priests, c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes andMourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, c.The Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow?And with such maimed rites? This doth betokenThe corse they follow did with desperate handFordo it own life.  Twas of some estate.Couch we awhile and mark.[_Retiring with Horatio._]LAERTES.What ceremony else?HAMLET.That is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.LAERTES.What ceremony else?PRIEST.Her obsequies have been as far enlarg dAs we have warranties. Her death was doubtful;And but that great command o ersways the order,She should in ground unsanctified have lodg dTill the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,Her maiden strewments, and the bringing homeOf bell and burial.LAERTES.Must there no more be done?PRIEST.No more be done.We should profane the service of the deadTo sing sage requiem and such rest to herAs to peace-parted souls.LAERTES.Lay her i  th earth,And from her fair and unpolluted fleshMay violets spring. I tell thee, churlish priest,A minist ring angel shall my sister beWhen thou liest howling.HAMLET.What, the fair Ophelia?QUEEN.[_Scattering flowers._] Sweets to the sweet. Farewell.I hop d thou shouldst have been my Hamlet s wife;I thought thy bride-bed to have deck d, sweet maid,And not have strew d thy grave.LAERTES.O, treble woeFall ten times treble on that cursed headWhose wicked deed thy most ingenious senseDepriv d thee of. Hold off the earth a while,Till I have caught her once more in mine arms.[_Leaps into the grave._]Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,Till of this flat a mountain you have made,To o ertop old Pelion or the skyish headOf blue Olympus.HAMLET.[_Advancing._]What is he whose griefBears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrowConjures the wand ring stars, and makes them standLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,Hamlet the Dane.[_Leaps into the grave._]LAERTES.[_Grappling with him._] The devil take thy soul!HAMLET.Thou pray st not well.I prithee take thy fingers from my throat;For though I am not splenative and rash,Yet have I in me something dangerous,Which let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand!KING.Pluck them asunder.QUEEN.Hamlet! Hamlet!All.Gentlemen!HORATIO.Good my lord, be quiet.[_The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave._]HAMLET.Why, I will fight with him upon this themeUntil my eyelids will no longer wag.QUEEN.O my son, what theme?HAMLET.I lov d Ophelia; forty thousand brothersCould not, with all their quantity of love,Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?KING.O, he is mad, Laertes.QUEEN.For love of God forbear him!HAMLET. Swounds, show me what thou lt do:Woul t weep? woul t fight? woul t fast? woul t tear thyself?Woul t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?I ll do t. Dost thou come here to whine?To outface me with leaping in her grave?Be buried quick with her, and so will I.And if thou prate of mountains, let them throwMillions of acres on us, till our ground,Singeing his pate against the burning zone,Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou lt mouth,I ll rant as well as thou.QUEEN.This is mere madness:And thus awhile the fit will work on him;Anon, as patient as the female dove,When that her golden couplets are disclos d,His silence will sit drooping.HAMLET.Hear you, sir;What is the reason that you use me thus?I lov d you ever. But it is no matter.Let Hercules himself do what he may,The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.[_Exit._]KING.I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.[_Exit Horatio._][_To Laertes_]Strengthen your patience in our last night s speech;We ll put the matter to the present push. Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.This grave shall have a living monument.An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;Till then in patience our proceeding be.[_Exeunt._] SCENE II. A hall in the Castle.Enter Hamlet and Horatio.HAMLET.So much for this, sir. Now let me see the other;You do remember all the circumstance?HORATIO.Remember it, my lord!HAMLET.Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fightingThat would not let me sleep. Methought I layWorse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,And prais d be rashness for it, let us know,Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,When our deep plots do pall; and that should teach usThere s a divinity that shapes our ends,Rough-hew them how we will.HORATIO.That is most certain.HAMLET.Up from my cabin,My sea-gown scarf d about me, in the darkGrop d I to find out them; had my desire,Finger d their packet, and in fine, withdrewTo mine own room again, making so bold,My fears forgetting manners, to unsealTheir grand commission; where I found, Horatio,Oh royal knavery! an exact command,Larded with many several sorts of reasons,Importing Denmark s health, and England s too,With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,That on the supervise, no leisure bated,No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,My head should be struck off.HORATIO.Is t possible?HAMLET.Here s the commission, read it at more leisure.But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?HORATIO.I beseech you.HAMLET.Being thus benetted round with villanies, Or I could make a prologue to my brains,They had begun the play, I sat me down,Devis d a new commission, wrote it fair:I once did hold it, as our statists do,A baseness to write fair, and labour d muchHow to forget that learning; but, sir, nowIt did me yeoman s service. Wilt thou knowThe effect of what I wrote?HORATIO.Ay, good my lord.HAMLET.An earnest conjuration from the King,As England was his faithful tributary,As love between them like the palm might flourish,As peace should still her wheaten garland wearAnd stand a comma  tween their amities,And many such-like  as es of great charge,That on the view and know of these contents,Without debatement further, more or less,He should the bearers put to sudden death,Not shriving-time allow d.HORATIO.How was this seal d?HAMLET.Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.I had my father s signet in my purse,Which was the model of that Danish seal:Folded the writ up in the form of the other,Subscrib d it: gave t th impression; plac d it safely,The changeling never known. Now, the next dayWas our sea-fight, and what to this was sequentThou know st already.HORATIO.So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to t.HAMLET.Why, man, they did make love to this employment.They are not near my conscience; their defeatDoes by their own insinuation grow. Tis dangerous when the baser nature comesBetween the pass and fell incensed pointsOf mighty opposites.HORATIO.Why, what a king is this!HAMLET.Does it not, thinks t thee, stand me now upon, He that hath kill d my king, and whor d my mother,Popp d in between th election and my hopes,Thrown out his angle for my proper life,And with such cozenage is t not perfect conscienceTo quit him with this arm? And is t not to be damn dTo let this canker of our nature comeIn further evil?HORATIO.It must be shortly known to him from EnglandWhat is the issue of the business there.HAMLET.It will be short. The interim is mine;And a man s life s no more than to say  One .But I am very sorry, good Horatio,That to Laertes I forgot myself;For by the image of my cause I seeThe portraiture of his. I ll court his favours.But sure the bravery of his grief did put meInto a tow ring passion.HORATIO.Peace, who comes here?Enter Osric.OSRIC.Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.HAMLET.I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this waterfly?HORATIO.No, my good lord.HAMLET.Thy state is the more gracious; for  tis a vice to know him. He hathmuch land, and fertile; let a beast be lord of beasts, and his cribshall stand at the king s mess;  tis a chough; but, as I say, spaciousin the possession of dirt.OSRIC.Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thingto you from his Majesty.HAMLET.I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to hisright use;  tis for the head.OSRIC.I thank your lordship,  tis very hot.HAMLET.No, believe me,  tis very cold, the wind is northerly.OSRIC.It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.HAMLET.Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.OSRIC.Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as  twere I cannot tell how.But, my lord, his Majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid agreat wager on your head. Sir, this is the matter, HAMLET.I beseech you, remember, [_Hamlet moves him to put on his hat._]OSRIC.Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newlycome to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of mostexcellent differences, of very soft society and great showing. Indeed,to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry; foryou shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.HAMLET.Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I know, todivide him inventorially would dizzy th arithmetic of memory, and yetbut yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity ofextolment, I take him to be a soul of great article and his infusion ofsuch dearth and rareness as, to make true diction of him, his semblableis his mirror and who else would trace him his umbrage, nothing more.OSRIC.Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.HAMLET.The concernancy, sir? Why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawerbreath?OSRIC.Sir?HORATIO.Is t not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do t, sir,really.HAMLET.What imports the nomination of this gentleman?OSRIC.Of Laertes?HORATIO.His purse is empty already, all s golden words are spent.HAMLET.Of him, sir.OSRIC.I know you are not ignorant, HAMLET.I would you did, sir; yet in faith if you did, it would not muchapprove me. Well, sir?OSRIC.You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is, HAMLET.I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence;but to know a man well were to know himself.OSRIC.I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him, by themin his meed he s unfellowed.HAMLET.What s his weapon?OSRIC.Rapier and dagger.HAMLET.That s two of his weapons. But well.OSRIC.The King, sir, hath wager d with him six Barbary horses, against thewhich he has imponed, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards,with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so. Three of the carriages,in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, mostdelicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.HAMLET.What call you the carriages?HORATIO.I knew you must be edified by the margin ere you had done.OSRIC.The carriages, sir, are the hangers.HAMLET.The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could carry cannonby our sides. I would it might be hangers till then. But on. SixBarbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and threeliberal conceited carriages: that s the French bet against the Danish.Why is this all imponed, as you call it?OSRIC.The King, sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes between you and him, heshall not exceed you three hits. He hath laid on twelve for nine. Andit would come to immediate trial if your lordship would vouchsafe theanswer.HAMLET.How if I answer no?OSRIC.I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.HAMLET.Sir, I will walk here in the hall. If it please his Majesty, it is thebreathing time of day with me. Let the foils be brought, the gentlemanwilling, and the King hold his purpose, I will win for him if I can; ifnot, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.OSRIC.Shall I re-deliver you e en so?HAMLET.To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.OSRIC.I commend my duty to your lordship.HAMLET.Yours, yours.[_Exit Osric._]He does well to commend it himself, there are no tongues else for sturn.HORATIO.This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.HAMLET.He did comply with his dug before he suck d it. Thus has he, and manymore of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,  only gotthe tune of the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of yeastycollection, which carries them through and through the most fanned andwinnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles areout.Enter a Lord.LORD.My lord, his Majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who bringsback to him that you attend him in the hall. He sends to know if yourpleasure hold to play with Laertes or that you will take longer time.HAMLET.I am constant to my purposes, they follow the King s pleasure. If hisfitness speaks, mine is ready. Now or whensoever, provided I be so ableas now.LORD.The King and Queen and all are coming down.HAMLET.In happy time.LORD.The Queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertesbefore you fall to play.HAMLET.She well instructs me.[_Exit Lord._]HORATIO.You will lose this wager, my lord.HAMLET.I do not think so. Since he went into France, I have been in continualpractice. I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not think how illall s here about my heart: but it is no matter.HORATIO.Nay, good my lord.HAMLET.It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as wouldperhaps trouble a woman.HORATIO.If your mind dislike anything, obey it. I will forestall their repairhither, and say you are not fit.HAMLET.Not a whit, we defy augury. There s a special providence in the fall ofa sparrow. If it be now,  tis not to come; if it be not to come, itwill be now; if it be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all.Since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is t to leave betimes?Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric and Attendants with foils c.KING.Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.[_The King puts Laertes s hand into Hamlet s._]HAMLET.Give me your pardon, sir. I have done you wrong;But pardon t as you are a gentleman.This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,How I am punish d with sore distraction.What I have doneThat might your nature, honour, and exceptionRoughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.Was t Hamlet wrong d Laertes? Never Hamlet.If Hamlet from himself be ta en away,And when he s not himself does wrong Laertes,Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.Who does it, then? His madness. If t be so,Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong d;His madness is poor Hamlet s enemy.Sir, in this audience,Let my disclaiming from a purpos d evilFree me so far in your most generous thoughtsThat I have shot my arrow o er the houseAnd hurt my brother.LAERTES.I am satisfied in nature,Whose motive in this case should stir me mostTo my revenge. But in my terms of honourI stand aloof, and will no reconcilementTill by some elder masters of known honourI have a voice and precedent of peaceTo keep my name ungor d. But till that timeI do receive your offer d love like love,And will not wrong it.HAMLET.I embrace it freely,And will this brother s wager frankly play. Give us the foils; come on.LAERTES.Come, one for me.HAMLET.I ll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignoranceYour skill shall like a star i  th  darkest night,Stick fiery off indeed.LAERTES.You mock me, sir.HAMLET.No, by this hand.KING.Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,You know the wager?HAMLET.Very well, my lord.Your Grace has laid the odds o  the weaker side.KING.I do not fear it. I have seen you both;But since he is better d, we have therefore odds.LAERTES.This is too heavy. Let me see another.HAMLET.This likes me well. These foils have all a length?[_They prepare to play._]OSRIC.Ay, my good lord.KING.Set me the stoups of wine upon that table.If Hamlet give the first or second hit,Or quit in answer of the third exchange,Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;The King shall drink to Hamlet s better breath,And in the cup an union shall he throwRicher than that which four successive kingsIn Denmark s crown have worn. Give me the cups;And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,The trumpet to the cannoneer without,The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth, Now the King drinks to Hamlet.  Come, begin.And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.HAMLET.Come on, sir.LAERTES.Come, my lord.[_They play._]HAMLET.One.LAERTES.No.HAMLET.udgement.OSRIC.A hit, a very palpable hit.LAERTES.Well; again.KING.Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;Here s to thy health.[_Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within._]Give him the cup.HAMLET.I ll play this bout first; set it by awhile.[_They play._]Come. Another hit; what say you?LAERTES.A touch, a touch, I do confess.KING.Our son shall win.QUEEN.He s fat, and scant of breath.Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows.The Queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.HAMLET.Good madam.KING.Gertrude, do not drink.QUEEN.I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.KING.[_Aside._] It is the poison d cup; it is too late.HAMLET.I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.QUEEN.Come, let me wipe thy face.LAERTES.My lord, I ll hit him now.KING.I do not think t.LAERTES.[_Aside._] And yet  tis almost  gainst my conscience.HAMLET.Come for the third, Laertes. You do but dally.I pray you pass with your best violence.I am afeard you make a wanton of me.LAERTES.Say you so? Come on.[_They play._]OSRIC.Nothing neither way.LAERTES.Have at you now.[_Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, andHamlet wounds Laertes._]KING.Part them; they are incens d.HAMLET.Nay, come again![_The Queen falls._]OSRIC.Look to the Queen there, ho!HORATIO.They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?OSRIC.How is t, Laertes?LAERTES.Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric.I am justly kill d with mine own treachery.HAMLET.How does the Queen?KING.She swoons to see them bleed.QUEEN.No, no, the drink, the drink! O my dear Hamlet!The drink, the drink! I am poison d.[_Dies._]HAMLET.O villany! Ho! Let the door be lock d:Treachery! Seek it out.[_Laertes falls._]LAERTES.It is here, Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slain.No medicine in the world can do thee good.In thee there is not half an hour of life;The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,Unbated and envenom d. The foul practiceHath turn d itself on me. Lo, here I lie,Never to rise again. Thy mother s poison d.I can no more. The King, the King s to blame.HAMLET.The point envenom d too!Then, venom, to thy work.[_Stabs the King._]OSRIC and LORDS.Treason! treason!KING.O yet defend me, friends. I am but hurt.HAMLET.Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?Follow my mother.[_King dies._]LAERTES.He is justly serv d.It is a poison temper d by himself.Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet.Mine and my father s death come not upon thee,Nor thine on me.[_Dies._]HAMLET.Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.I am dead, Horatio. Wretched Queen, adieu.You that look pale and tremble at this chance,That are but mutes or audience to this act,Had I but time, as this fell sergeant, death,Is strict in his arrest, O, I could tell you, But let it be. Horatio, I am dead,Thou liv st; report me and my cause arightTo the unsatisfied.HORATIO.Never believe it.I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.Here s yet some liquor left.HAMLET.As th art a man,Give me the cup. Let go; by Heaven, I ll have t.O good Horatio, what a wounded name,Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me.If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,Absent thee from felicity awhile,And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,To tell my story.[_March afar off, and shot within._]What warlike noise is this?OSRIC.Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,To the ambassadors of England givesThis warlike volley.HAMLET.O, I die, Horatio.The potent poison quite o er-crows my spirit:I cannot live to hear the news from England,But I do prophesy th election lightsOn Fortinbras. He has my dying voice.So tell him, with the occurrents more and less,Which have solicited. The rest is silence.[_Dies._]HORATIO.Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince,And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.Why does the drum come hither?[_March within._]Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors and others.FORTINBRAS.Where is this sight?HORATIO.What is it you would see?If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.FORTINBRAS.This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,That thou so many princes at a shotSo bloodily hast struck?FIRST AMBASSADOR.The sight is dismal;And our affairs from England come too late.The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,To tell him his commandment is fulfill d,That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.Where should we have our thanks?HORATIO.Not from his mouth,Had it th ability of life to thank you.He never gave commandment for their death.But since, so jump upon this bloody question,You from the Polack wars, and you from EnglandAre here arriv d, give order that these bodiesHigh on a stage be placed to the view,And let me speak to th  yet unknowing worldHow these things came about. So shall you hearOf carnal, bloody and unnatural acts,Of accidental judgements, casual slaughters,Of deaths put on by cunning and forc d cause,And, in this upshot, purposes mistookFall n on the inventors  heads. All this can ITruly deliver.FORTINBRAS.Let us haste to hear it,And call the noblest to the audience.For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune.I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.HORATIO.Of that I shall have also cause to speak,And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more.But let this same be presently perform d,Even while men s minds are wild, lest more mischanceOn plots and errors happen.FORTINBRAS.Let four captainsBear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,For he was likely, had he been put on,To have prov d most royally; and for his passage,The soldiers  music and the rites of warSpeak loudly for him.Take up the bodies. Such a sight as thisBecomes the field, but here shows much amiss.Go, bid the soldiers shoot.[_A dead march._][_Exeunt, bearing off the bodies, after which a peal of ordnance isshot off._]
